    "### The Distribution of Words in a Human Language: Zipf's Law\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will be looking at a phenomenon of \"natural languages\" (i.e., human languages, such as English). As it turns out, when we look at the distribution of words in a different human languages, the distribution roughly follows what's called *Zipf's law* ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law)).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Zipf's law* states that given a large sample of words used, any word's frequency is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table (the word with rank 1 is the most frequently occurring word, the word with rank 2 is the second most frequently occurring word, etc). In this problem, you are going to test Zipf's law on a real dataset and explore some of its properties.\n",

      "MARLEY was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt\n",
      "whatever about that. The register of his burial was\n",
      "signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,\n",
      "and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and\n",
      "Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he\n",
      "chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a\n",
      "door-nail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my\n",
      "own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about\n",
      "a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to\n",
      "regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery\n",
      "in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors\n",
      "is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands\n",
      "shall not disturb it, or the Country's done for. You\n",
      "will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that\n",
      "Marley was as dead as a door-nail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did.\n",
      "How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were\n",
      "partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge\n",
      "was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole\n",
      "assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and\n",
      "sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully\n",
      "cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent\n",
      "man of business on the very day of the funeral,\n",
      "and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to\n",
      "the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley\n",
      "was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or\n",
      "nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going\n",
      "to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that\n",
      "Hamlet's Father died before the play began, there\n",
      "would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a\n",
      "stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\n",
      "than there would be in any other middle-aged\n",
      "gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy\n",
      "spot--say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance--\n",
      "literally to astonish his son's weak mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name.\n",
      "There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse\n",
      "door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as\n",
      "Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the\n",
      "business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley,\n",
      "but he answered to both names. It was all the\n",
      "same to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone,\n",
      "Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping,\n",
      "clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint,\n",
      "from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire;\n",
      "secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The\n",
      "cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed\n",
      "nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his\n",
      "eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his\n",
      "grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his\n",
      "eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low\n",
      "temperature always about with him; he iced his office in\n",
      "the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n",
      "\n",
      "External heat and cold had little influence on\n",
      "Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather\n",
      "chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he,\n",
      "no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no\n",
      "pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't\n",
      "know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and\n",
      "snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage\n",
      "over him in only one respect. They often \"came down\"\n",
      "handsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with\n",
      "gladsome looks, \"My dear Scrooge, how are you?\n",
      "When will you come to see me?\" No beggars implored\n",
      "him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him\n",
      "what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all\n",
      "his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of\n",
      "Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to\n",
      "know him; and when they saw him coming on, would\n",
      "tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and\n",
      "then would wag their tails as though they said, \"No\n",
      "eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing\n",
      "he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths\n",
      "of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance,\n",
      "was what the knowing ones call \"nuts\" to Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year,\n",
      "on Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his\n",
      "counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy\n",
      "withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside,\n",
      "go wheezing up and down, beating their hands\n",
      "upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the\n",
      "pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had\n",
      "only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--\n",
      "it had not been light all day--and candles were flaring\n",
      "in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like\n",
      "ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog\n",
      "came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was\n",
      "so dense without, that although the court was of the\n",
      "narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms.\n",
      "To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring\n",
      "everything, one might have thought that Nature\n",
      "lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open\n",
      "that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a\n",
      "dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying\n",
      "letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's\n",
      "fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one\n",
      "coal. But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept\n",
      "the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the\n",
      "clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted\n",
      "that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore\n",
      "the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to\n",
      "warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being\n",
      "a man of a strong imagination, he failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\" cried\n",
      "a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge's\n",
      "nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was\n",
      "the first intimation he had of his approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bah!\" said Scrooge, \"Humbug!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the\n",
      "fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's, that he was\n",
      "all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his\n",
      "eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Christmas a humbug, uncle!\" said Scrooge's\n",
      "nephew. \"You don't mean that, I am sure?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"Merry Christmas! What\n",
      "right have you to be merry? What reason have you\n",
      "to be merry? You're poor enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, then,\" returned the nephew gaily. \"What\n",
      "right have you to be dismal? What reason have you\n",
      "to be morose? You're rich enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur\n",
      "of the moment, said, \"Bah!\" again; and followed it up\n",
      "with \"Humbug.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be cross, uncle!\" said the nephew.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What else can I be,\" returned the uncle, \"when I\n",
      "live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas!\n",
      "Out upon merry Christmas! What's Christmas\n",
      "time to you but a time for paying bills without\n",
      "money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but\n",
      "not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books\n",
      "and having every item in 'em through a round dozen\n",
      "of months presented dead against you? If I could\n",
      "work my will,\" said Scrooge indignantly, \"every idiot\n",
      "who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips,\n",
      "should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried\n",
      "with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Uncle!\" pleaded the nephew.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nephew!\" returned the uncle sternly, \"keep Christmas\n",
      "in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Keep it!\" repeated Scrooge's nephew. \"But you\n",
      "don't keep it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me leave it alone, then,\" said Scrooge. \"Much\n",
      "good may it do you! Much good it has ever done\n",
      "you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are many things from which I might have\n",
      "derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare\n",
      "say,\" returned the nephew. \"Christmas among the\n",
      "rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas\n",
      "time, when it has come round--apart from the\n",
      "veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything\n",
      "belonging to it can be apart from that--as a\n",
      "good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant\n",
      "time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar\n",
      "of the year, when men and women seem by one consent\n",
      "to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think\n",
      "of people below them as if they really were\n",
      "fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race\n",
      "of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\n",
      "uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or\n",
      "silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me\n",
      "good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded.\n",
      "Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety,\n",
      "he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark\n",
      "for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me hear another sound from you,\" said\n",
      "Scrooge, \"and you'll keep your Christmas by losing\n",
      "your situation! You're quite a powerful speaker,\n",
      "sir,\" he added, turning to his nephew. \"I wonder you\n",
      "don't go into Parliament.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge said that he would see him--yes, indeed he\n",
      "did. He went the whole length of the expression,\n",
      "and said that he would see him in that extremity first.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why?\" cried Scrooge's nephew. \"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why did you get married?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because I fell in love.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because you fell in love!\" growled Scrooge, as if\n",
      "that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous\n",
      "than a merry Christmas. \"Good afternoon!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before\n",
      "that happened. Why give it as a reason for not\n",
      "coming now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you;\n",
      "why cannot we be friends?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so\n",
      "resolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I\n",
      "have been a party. But I have made the trial in\n",
      "homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas\n",
      "humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And A Happy New Year!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "His nephew left the room without an angry word,\n",
      "notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to\n",
      "bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who,\n",
      "cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\n",
      "them cordially.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's another fellow,\" muttered Scrooge; who\n",
      "overheard him: \"my clerk, with fifteen shillings a\n",
      "week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry\n",
      "Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had\n",
      "let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen,\n",
      "pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off,\n",
      "in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in\n",
      "their hands, and bowed to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,\" said one of the\n",
      "gentlemen, referring to his list. \"Have I the pleasure\n",
      "of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\"\n",
      "Scrooge replied. \"He died seven years ago, this very\n",
      "night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have no doubt his liberality is well represented\n",
      "by his surviving partner,\" said the gentleman, presenting\n",
      "his credentials.\n",
      "\n",
      "It certainly was; for they had been two kindred\n",
      "spirits. At the ominous word \"liberality,\" Scrooge\n",
      "frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials\n",
      "back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\"\n",
      "said the gentleman, taking up a pen, \"it is more than\n",
      "usually desirable that we should make some slight\n",
      "provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer\n",
      "greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in\n",
      "want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands\n",
      "are in want of common comforts, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are there no prisons?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Plenty of prisons,\" said the gentleman, laying down\n",
      "the pen again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the Union workhouses?\" demanded Scrooge.\n",
      "\"Are they still in operation?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are. Still,\" returned the gentleman, \"I wish\n",
      "I could say they were not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour,\n",
      "then?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Both very busy, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first,\n",
      "that something had occurred to stop them in their\n",
      "useful course,\" said Scrooge. \"I'm very glad to\n",
      "hear it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Under the impression that they scarcely furnish\n",
      "Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,\"\n",
      "returned the gentleman, \"a few of us are endeavouring\n",
      "to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink,\n",
      "and means of warmth. We choose this time, because\n",
      "it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt,\n",
      "and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down\n",
      "for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing!\" Scrooge replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You wish to be anonymous?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish to be left alone,\" said Scrooge. \"Since you\n",
      "ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer.\n",
      "I don't make merry myself at Christmas and I can't\n",
      "afford to make idle people merry. I help to support\n",
      "the establishments I have mentioned--they cost\n",
      "enough; and those who are badly off must go there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Many can't go there; and many would rather die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If they would rather die,\" said Scrooge, \"they had\n",
      "better do it, and decrease the surplus population.\n",
      "Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you might know it,\" observed the gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not my business,\" Scrooge returned. \"It's\n",
      "enough for a man to understand his own business, and\n",
      "not to interfere with other people's. Mine occupies\n",
      "me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue\n",
      "their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed\n",
      "his labours with an improved opinion of himself,\n",
      "and in a more facetious temper than was usual\n",

      "Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that\n",
      "people ran about with flaring links, proffering their\n",
      "services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct\n",
      "them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\n",
      "whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down\n",
      "at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became\n",
      "invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the\n",
      "clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if\n",
      "its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there.\n",
      "The cold became intense. In the main street, at the\n",
      "corner of the court, some labourers were repairing\n",
      "the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\n",
      "round which a party of ragged men and boys were\n",
      "gathered: warming their hands and winking their\n",
      "eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\n",
      "being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed,\n",
      "and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness\n",
      "of the shops where holly sprigs and berries\n",
      "crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale\n",
      "faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers'\n",
      "trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant,\n",
      "with which it was next to impossible to believe that\n",
      "such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything\n",
      "to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the\n",
      "mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks\n",
      "and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's\n",
      "household should; and even the little tailor, whom he\n",
      "had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for\n",
      "being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up\n",
      "to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean\n",
      "wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting\n",
      "cold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped\n",
      "the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such weather\n",
      "as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then\n",
      "indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The\n",
      "owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled\n",
      "by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\n",
      "stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with\n",
      "a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"God bless you, merry gentleman!\n",
      "         May nothing you dismay!\"\n",

      "Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action,\n",
      "that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to\n",
      "the fog and even more congenial frost.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house\n",
      "arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his\n",
      "stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant\n",
      "clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out,\n",
      "and put on his hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\" said\n",

      "\n",
      "\"If quite convenient, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not convenient,\" said Scrooge, \"and it's not\n",
      "fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you'd\n",
      "think yourself ill-used, I'll be bound?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The clerk smiled faintly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yet,\" said Scrooge, \"you don't think me ill-used,\n",
      "when I pay a day's wages for no work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every\n",
      "twenty-fifth of December!\" said Scrooge, buttoning\n",
      "his great-coat to the chin. \"But I suppose you must\n",
      "have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\n",
      "morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge\n",
      "walked out with a growl. The office was closed in a\n",
      "twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his\n",
      "white comforter dangling below his waist (for he\n",
      "boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill,\n",
      "at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in\n",
      "honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home\n",
      "to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play\n",
      "at blindman's-buff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual\n",
      "melancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and\n",
      "beguiled the rest of the evening with his\n",
      "banker's-book, went home to bed. He lived in\n",
      "chambers which had once belonged to his deceased\n",
      "partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a\n",
      "lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so\n",
      "little business to be, that one could scarcely help\n",
      "fancying it must have run there when it was a young\n",
      "house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses,\n",
      "and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough\n",
      "now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but\n",
      "Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.\n",
      "The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew\n",
      "its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands.\n",
      "The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway\n",
      "of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of\n",
      "the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\n",
      "threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all\n",
      "particular about the knocker on the door, except that it\n",
      "was very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had\n",
      "seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\n",
      "in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what\n",
      "is called fancy about him as any man in the city of\n",
      "London, even including--which is a bold word--the\n",
      "corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be\n",
      "borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one\n",
      "thought on Marley, since his last mention of his\n",
      "seven years' dead partner that afternoon. And then\n",
      "let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened\n",
      "that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door,\n",
      "saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate\n",
      "process of change--not a knocker, but Marley's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow\n",
      "as the other objects in the yard were, but had a\n",
      "dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark\n",
      "cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked\n",
      "at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly\n",
      "spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The\n",
      "hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\n",
      "and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly\n",
      "motionless. That, and its livid colour, made it\n",
      "horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the\n",
      "face and beyond its control, rather than a part of\n",
      "its own expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it\n",
      "was a knocker again.\n",
      "\n",
      "To say that he was not startled, or that his blood\n",
      "was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it\n",
      "had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue.\n",
      "But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished,\n",
      "turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did pause, with a moment's irresolution, before\n",
      "he shut the door; and he did look cautiously behind\n",
      "it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the\n",
      "sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the hall.\n",
      "But there was nothing on the back of the door, except\n",
      "the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he\n",
      "said \"Pooh, pooh!\" and closed it with a bang.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound resounded through the house like thunder.\n",
      "Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant's\n",
      "cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal\n",
      "of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to\n",
      "be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and\n",
      "walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too:\n",
      "trimming his candle as he went.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six\n",
      "up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad\n",
      "young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you\n",
      "might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken\n",
      "it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall\n",
      "and the door towards the balustrades: and done it\n",
      "easy. There was plenty of width for that, and room\n",
      "to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge\n",
      "thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before\n",
      "him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of\n",
      "the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well,\n",
      "so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with\n",
      "Scrooge's dip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that.\n",
      "Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But before\n",
      "he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms\n",
      "to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection\n",
      "of the face to desire to do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they\n",
      "should be. Nobody under the table, nobody under\n",
      "the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin\n",
      "ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had\n",
      "a cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under the\n",
      "bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown,\n",
      "which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\n",
      "against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard,\n",
      "old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three\n",
      "legs, and a poker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked\n",
      "himself in; double-locked himself in, which was not his\n",
      "custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off\n",
      "his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and\n",
      "his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take\n",
      "his gruel.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a\n",
      "bitter night. He was obliged to sit close to it, and\n",
      "brood over it, before he could extract the least\n",
      "sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel.\n",
      "The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch\n",
      "merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint\n",
      "Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.\n",
      "There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters;\n",
      "Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending\n",
      "through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams,\n",
      "Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats,\n",
      "hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts;\n",
      "and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came\n",
      "like the ancient Prophet's rod, and swallowed up the\n",
      "whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at first,\n",
      "with power to shape some picture on its surface from\n",
      "the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would\n",
      "have been a copy of old Marley's head on every one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Humbug!\" said Scrooge; and walked across the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "After several turns, he sat down again. As he\n",
      "threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened\n",
      "to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the\n",
      "room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten\n",
      "with a chamber in the highest story of the\n",
      "building. It was with great astonishment, and with\n",
      "a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he\n",
      "saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in\n",
      "the outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it\n",
      "rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute,\n",
      "but it seemed an hour. The bells ceased as they had\n",
      "begun, together. They were succeeded by a clanking\n",
      "noise, deep down below; as if some person were\n",
      "dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the\n",
      "wine-merchant's cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have\n",
      "heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as\n",
      "dragging chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound,\n",
      "and then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors\n",
      "below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight\n",
      "towards his door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's humbug still!\" said Scrooge. \"I won't believe it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His colour changed though, when, without a pause,\n",
      "it came on through the heavy door, and passed into\n",
      "the room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the\n",
      "dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, \"I know\n",
      "him; Marley's Ghost!\" and fell again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail,\n",
      "usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on\n",
      "the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts,\n",
      "and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was\n",
      "clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound\n",
      "about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge\n",
      "observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks,\n",
      "ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel.\n",
      "His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him,\n",
      "and looking through his waistcoat, could see\n",
      "the two buttons on his coat behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no\n",
      "bowels, but he had never believed it until now.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he\n",
      "looked the phantom through and through, and saw\n",
      "it standing before him; though he felt the chilling\n",
      "influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very\n",
      "texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head\n",
      "and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before;\n",
      "he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How now!\" said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever.\n",
      "\"What do you want with me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Much!\"--Marley's voice, no doubt about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who are you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ask me who I was.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who were you then?\" said Scrooge, raising his\n",
      "voice. \"You're particular, for a shade.\" He was going\n",
      "to say \"to a shade,\" but substituted this, as more\n",
      "appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you--can you sit down?\" asked Scrooge, looking\n",
      "doubtfully at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do it, then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge asked the question, because he didn't know\n",
      "whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in\n",
      "a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event\n",
      "of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity\n",
      "of an embarrassing explanation. But the ghost sat\n",
      "down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he\n",
      "were quite used to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't believe in me,\" observed the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of\n",
      "your senses?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you doubt your senses?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because,\" said Scrooge, \"a little thing affects them.\n",
      "A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may\n",
      "be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of\n",
      "cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There's more of\n",
      "gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking\n",
      "jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means\n",
      "waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be\n",
      "smart, as a means of distracting his own attention,\n",
      "and keeping down his terror; for the spectre's voice\n",
      "disturbed the very marrow in his bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "To sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence\n",
      "for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very\n",
      "deuce with him. There was something very awful,\n",
      "too, in the spectre's being provided with an infernal\n",
      "atmosphere of its own. Scrooge could not feel it\n",
      "himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the\n",
      "Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts,\n",
      "and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour\n",
      "from an oven.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see this toothpick?\" said Scrooge, returning\n",
      "quickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned;\n",
      "and wishing, though it were only for a second, to\n",
      "divert the vision's stony gaze from himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do,\" replied the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are not looking at it,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I see it,\" said the Ghost, \"notwithstanding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well!\" returned Scrooge, \"I have but to swallow\n",
      "this, and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a\n",
      "legion of goblins, all of my own creation. Humbug,\n",
      "I tell you! humbug!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook\n",
      "its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that\n",
      "Scrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself\n",
      "from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was\n",
      "his horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage\n",
      "round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors,\n",
      "its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands\n",
      "before his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mercy!\" he said. \"Dreadful apparition, why do\n",
      "you trouble me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Man of the worldly mind!\" replied the Ghost, \"do\n",
      "you believe in me or not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"I must. But why do spirits\n",
      "walk the earth, and why do they come to me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is required of every man,\" the Ghost returned,\n",
      "\"that the spirit within him should walk abroad among\n",
      "his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that\n",
      "spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so\n",
      "after death. It is doomed to wander through the\n",
      "world--oh, woe is me!--and witness what it cannot\n",
      "share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to\n",
      "happiness!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain\n",
      "and wrung its shadowy hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are fettered,\" said Scrooge, trembling. \"Tell\n",
      "me why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wear the chain I forged in life,\" replied the Ghost.\n",
      "\"I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded\n",
      "it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I\n",
      "wore it. Is its pattern strange to you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge trembled more and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Or would you know,\" pursued the Ghost, \"the\n",
      "weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself?\n",
      "It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven\n",
      "Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it, since.\n",
      "It is a ponderous chain!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the\n",
      "expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty\n",
      "or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see\n",
      "nothing.\n",

      "\"Business!\" cried the Ghost, wringing its hands\n",
      "again. \"Mankind was my business. The common\n",
      "welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance,\n",
      "and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings\n",

      "comprehensive ocean of my business!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It held up its chain at arm's length, as if that were\n",
      "the cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it\n",
      "heavily upon the ground again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At this time of the rolling year,\" the spectre said,\n",
      "\"I suffer most. Why did I walk through crowds of\n",

      "when the bell tolls One.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Couldn't I take 'em all at once, and have it over,\n",

      "\n",
      "When it had said these words, the spectre took its\n",
      "wrapper from the table, and bound it round its head,\n",
      "as before. Scrooge knew this, by the smart sound its\n",
      "teeth made, when the jaws were brought together\n",
      "by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again,\n",
      "and found his supernatural visitor confronting him\n",

      "\n",
      "It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did.\n",
      "When they were within two paces of each other,\n",
      "Marley's Ghost held up its hand, warning him to\n",
      "come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear:\n",
      "for on the raising of the hand, he became sensible\n",
      "of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of\n",
      "lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and\n",
      "self-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment,\n",
      "joined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the\n",
      "bleak, dark night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge followed to the window: desperate in his\n",
      "curiosity. He looked out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither\n",
      "and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they\n",
      "went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley's\n",
      "Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments)\n",
      "were linked together; none were free. Many had\n",
      "been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He\n",
      "had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white\n",
      "waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to\n",
      "its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist\n",
      "a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below,\n",
      "upon a door-step. The misery with them all was,\n",
      "clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in\n",
      "human matters, and had lost the power for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist\n",
      "enshrouded them, he could not tell. But they and\n",
      "their spirit voices faded together; and the night became\n",
      "as it had been when he walked home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door\n",
      "by which the Ghost had entered. It was double-locked,\n",
      "as he had locked it with his own hands, and\n",
      "the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say \"Humbug!\"\n",
      "but stopped at the first syllable. And being,\n",
      "from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues\n",
      "of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or\n",
      "the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of\n",
      "the hour, much in need of repose; went straight to\n",
      "bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the\n",
      "instant.\n",

      "STAVE II:  THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS\n",

      "WHEN Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that looking out of bed,\n",
      "he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from\n",
      "the opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to\n",
      "pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a\n",
      "neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened\n",
      "for the hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "To his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from\n",
      "six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to\n",
      "twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he\n",
      "went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have\n",
      "got into the works. Twelve!\n",
      "\n",
      "He touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most\n",
      "preposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve:\n",
      "and stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it isn't possible,\" said Scrooge, \"that I can have\n",
      "slept through a whole day and far into another night. It\n",
      "isn't possible that anything has happened to the sun, and\n",
      "this is twelve at noon!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed,\n",
      "and groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub\n",
      "the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he\n",
      "could see anything; and could see very little then. All he\n",
      "could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely\n",
      "cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro,\n",
      "and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been\n",
      "if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the\n",
      "world.  This was a great relief, because \"three days after sight\n",
      "of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his\n",
      "order,\" and so forth, would have become a mere United States'\n",
      "security if there were no days to count by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought\n",
      "it over and over and over, and could make nothing of it.  The more he\n",
      "thought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured\n",
      "not to think, the more he thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved\n",
      "within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his\n",
      "mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first\n",
      "position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through,\n",
      "\"Was it a dream or not?\"\n",

      "more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned\n",
      "him of a visitation when the bell tolled one.  He resolved to lie\n",
      "awake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could\n",
      "no more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the\n",
      "wisest resolution in his power.\n",

      "The quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he\n",

      "\"The hour itself,\" said Scrooge, triumphantly, \"and nothing else!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a\n",
      "deep, dull, hollow, melancholy ONE.  Light flashed up in the room\n",
      "upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a\n",
      "hand. Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his\n",
      "back, but those to which his face was addressed. The curtains\n",
      "of his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a\n",
      "half-recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the\n",
      "unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now\n",
      "to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a strange figure--like a child: yet not so like a\n",
      "child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural\n",
      "medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded\n",
      "from the view, and being diminished to a child's proportions.\n",
      "Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was\n",
      "white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in\n",
      "it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were\n",
      "very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold\n",
      "were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately\n",
      "formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic\n",
      "of the purest white; and round its waist was bound\n",
      "a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held\n",
      "a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular\n",
      "contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed\n",
      "with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was,\n",
      "that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear\n",
      "jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was\n",
      "doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a\n",
      "great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing\n",
      "steadiness, was not its strangest quality. For as its belt\n",
      "sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another,\n",
      "and what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so\n",
      "the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a\n",
      "thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs,\n",
      "now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a\n",
      "body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible\n",
      "in the dense gloom wherein they melted away. And in the\n",
      "very wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and\n",
      "clear as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to\n",
      "me?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if\n",
      "instead of being so close beside him, it were at a distance.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No. Your past.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps, Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if\n",
      "anybody could have asked him; but he had a special desire\n",
      "to see the Spirit in his cap; and begged him to be covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\" exclaimed the Ghost, \"would you so soon put out,\n",
      "with worldly hands, the light I give? Is it not enough\n",
      "that you are one of those whose passions made this cap, and\n",
      "force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon\n",
      "my brow!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend\n",
      "or any knowledge of having wilfully \"bonneted\" the Spirit at\n",
      "any period of his life. He then made bold to inquire what\n",
      "business brought him there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your welfare!\" said the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not\n",
      "help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been\n",
      "more conducive to that end. The Spirit must have heard\n",
      "him thinking, for it said immediately:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your reclamation, then. Take heed!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him\n",
      "gently by the arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rise! and walk with me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the\n",
      "weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes;\n",
      "that bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below\n",
      "freezing; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers,\n",
      "dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at\n",
      "that time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman's hand,\n",
      "was not to be resisted. He rose: but finding that the Spirit\n",
      "made towards the window, clasped his robe in supplication.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am a mortal,\" Scrooge remonstrated, \"and liable to fall.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bear but a touch of my hand there,\" said the Spirit,\n",
      "laying it upon his heart, \"and you shall be upheld in more\n",
      "than this!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall,\n",
      "and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either\n",
      "hand. The city had entirely vanished. Not a vestige of it\n",
      "was to be seen. The darkness and the mist had vanished\n",
      "with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon\n",
      "the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good Heaven!\" said Scrooge, clasping his hands together,\n",
      "as he looked about him. \"I was bred in this place. I was\n",
      "a boy here!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch,\n",
      "though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still\n",
      "present to the old man's sense of feeling. He was conscious\n",
      "of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected\n",
      "with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares\n",
      "long, long, forgotten!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your lip is trembling,\" said the Ghost. \"And what is\n",
      "that upon your cheek?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice,\n",
      "that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You recollect the way?\" inquired the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",

      "gate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared\n",
      "in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river.\n",
      "Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them\n",
      "with boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in\n",
      "country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys\n",
      "were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the\n",
      "broad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air\n",
      "laughed to hear it!\n",

      "all bounds to see them! Why did his cold eye glisten, and\n",
      "his heart leap up as they went past! Why was he filled\n",
      "with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry\n",
      "Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for\n",

      "\"The school is not quite deserted,\" said the Ghost. \"A\n",
      "solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "They left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and\n",
      "soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little\n",
      "weathercock-surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell\n",
      "hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of broken\n",
      "fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls\n",
      "were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their\n",
      "gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables;\n",
      "and the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass.\n",
      "Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for\n",
      "entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open\n",
      "doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished,\n",
      "cold, and vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a\n",
      "chilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow\n",
      "with too much getting up by candle-light, and not too\n",
      "much to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a\n",
      "door at the back of the house. It opened before them, and\n",
      "disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by\n",
      "lines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of these a lonely\n",
      "boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down\n",
      "upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he\n",
      "used to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle\n",
      "from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the\n",
      "half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among\n",
      "the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle\n",
      "swinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in\n",
      "the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening\n",
      "influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his\n",
      "younger self, intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man, in\n",
      "foreign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at:\n",
      "stood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his belt, and\n",
      "leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it's Ali Baba!\" Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. \"It's\n",
      "dear old honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know! One Christmas\n",
      "time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone,\n",
      "he did come, for the first time, just like that. Poor boy! And\n",
      "Valentine,\" said Scrooge, \"and his wild brother, Orson; there\n",
      "they go! And what's his name, who was put down in his\n",
      "drawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don't you see him!\n",
      "And the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the Genii;\n",
      "there he is upon his head! Serve him right. I'm glad of it.\n",
      "What business had he to be married to the Princess!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature\n",
      "on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between\n",
      "laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited\n",
      "face; would have been a surprise to his business friends in\n",
      "the city, indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's the Parrot!\" cried Scrooge. \"Green body and\n",
      "yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the\n",
      "top of his head; there he is! Poor Robin Crusoe, he called\n",
      "him, when he came home again after sailing round the\n",
      "island. 'Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin\n",
      "Crusoe?'  The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't.\n",
      "It was the Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running\n",
      "for his life to the little creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his\n",
      "usual character, he said, in pity for his former self, \"Poor\n",
      "boy!\" and cried again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish,\" Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his\n",
      "pocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with his\n",
      "cuff: \"but it's too late now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the matter?\" asked the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" said Scrooge. \"Nothing. There was a boy\n",
      "singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should\n",
      "like to have given him something: that's all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand:\n",
      "saying as it did so, \"Let us see another Christmas!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the\n",
      "room became a little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk,\n",
      "the windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the\n",
      "ceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how\n",
      "all this was brought about, Scrooge knew no more than you\n",
      "do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything\n",
      "had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all\n",
      "the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly.\n",
      "Scrooge looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of\n",
      "his head, glanced anxiously towards the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "It opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy,\n",
      "came darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and\n",
      "often kissing him, addressed him as her \"Dear, dear\n",
      "brother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have come to bring you home, dear brother!\" said the\n",
      "child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh.\n",
      "\"To bring you home, home, home!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Home, little Fan?\" returned the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes!\" said the child, brimful of glee. \"Home, for good\n",
      "and all. Home, for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder\n",
      "than he used to be, that home's like Heaven! He spoke so\n",
      "gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that\n",
      "I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come\n",
      "home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach\n",
      "to bring you. And you're to be a man!\" said the child,\n",
      "opening her eyes, \"and are never to come back here; but\n",
      "first, we're to be together all the Christmas long, and have\n",
      "the merriest time in all the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are quite a woman, little Fan!\" exclaimed the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his\n",
      "head; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on\n",
      "tiptoe to embrace him. Then she began to drag him, in her\n",
      "childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to\n",
      "go, accompanied her.\n",
      "\n",
      "A terrible voice in the hall cried, \"Bring down Master\n",
      "Scrooge's box, there!\" and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster\n",
      "himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious\n",
      "condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind\n",
      "by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him and his\n",
      "sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best-parlour that\n",
      "ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial\n",
      "and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold.\n",
      "Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a\n",
      "block of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments\n",
      "of those dainties to the young people: at the same time,\n",
      "sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of \"something\"\n",
      "to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman,\n",
      "but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had\n",
      "rather not. Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied\n",
      "on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster\n",
      "good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove\n",
      "gaily down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the\n",
      "hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens\n",
      "like spray.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have\n",
      "withered,\" said the Ghost. \"But she had a large heart!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So she had,\" cried Scrooge. \"You're right. I will not\n",
      "gainsay it, Spirit. God forbid!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She died a woman,\" said the Ghost, \"and had, as I think,\n",
      "children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One child,\" Scrooge returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True,\" said the Ghost. \"Your nephew!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly,\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Although they had but that moment left the school behind\n",
      "them, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city,\n",
      "where shadowy passengers passed and repassed; where shadowy\n",
      "carts and coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and\n",
      "tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough, by\n",
      "the dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas\n",
      "time again; but it was evening, and the streets were\n",
      "lighted up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked\n",
      "Scrooge if he knew it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Know it!\" said Scrooge. \"Was I apprenticed here!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh\n",
      "wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two\n",
      "inches taller he must have knocked his head against the\n",
      "ceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it's Fezziwig\n",
      "alive again!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the\n",
      "clock, which pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his\n",
      "hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over\n",
      "himself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and\n",
      "called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly\n",
      "in, accompanied by his fellow-'prentice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dick Wilkins, to be sure!\" said Scrooge to the Ghost.\n",
      "\"Bless me, yes. There he is. He was very much attached\n",
      "to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear, dear!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yo ho, my boys!\" said Fezziwig. \"No more work to-night.\n",
      "Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let's\n",
      "have the shutters up,\" cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap\n",
      "of his hands, \"before a man can say Jack Robinson!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it!\n",
      "They charged into the street with the shutters--one, two,\n",
      "three--had 'em up in their places--four, five, six--barred\n",
      "'em and pinned 'em--seven, eight, nine--and came back\n",
      "before you could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hilli-ho!\" cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the\n",
      "high desk, with wonderful agility. \"Clear away, my lads,\n",
      "and let's have lots of room here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup,\n",
      "Ebenezer!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Clear away! There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared\n",
      "away, or couldn't have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking\n",
      "on. It was done in a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if\n",
      "it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was\n",
      "swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon\n",
      "the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and\n",
      "bright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon a winter's\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the\n",
      "lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty\n",
      "stomach-aches. In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial\n",
      "smile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and\n",
      "lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they\n",
      "broke. In came all the young men and women employed in\n",
      "the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the\n",
      "baker. In came the cook, with her brother's particular friend,\n",
      "the milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was\n",
      "suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying\n",
      "to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who\n",
      "was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress.\n",
      "In they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly,\n",
      "some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling;\n",
      "in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went,\n",
      "twenty couple at once; hands half round and back again\n",
      "the other way; down the middle and up again; round\n",
      "and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old\n",
      "top couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top\n",
      "couple starting off again, as soon as they got there; all top\n",
      "couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them! When\n",
      "this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his\n",
      "hands to stop the dance, cried out, \"Well done!\" and the\n",
      "fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially\n",
      "provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his\n",
      "reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no\n",
      "dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home,\n",
      "exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man\n",
      "resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more\n",
      "dances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there\n",
      "was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece\n",
      "of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer.\n",
      "But the great effect of the evening came after the Roast\n",
      "and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort\n",
      "of man who knew his business better than you or I could\n",
      "have told it him!) struck up \"Sir Roger de Coverley.\"  Then\n",
      "old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top\n",
      "couple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them;\n",
      "three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were\n",
      "not to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had no\n",
      "notion of walking.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if they had been twice as many--ah, four times--old\n",
      "Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would\n",
      "Mrs. Fezziwig. As to her, she was worthy to be his partner\n",
      "in every sense of the term. If that's not high praise, tell me\n",
      "higher, and I'll use it. A positive light appeared to issue\n",
      "from Fezziwig's calves. They shone in every part of the\n",
      "dance like moons. You couldn't have predicted, at any given\n",
      "time, what would have become of them next. And when old\n",
      "Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the dance;\n",
      "advance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and\n",
      "curtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to\n",
      "your place; Fezziwig \"cut\"--cut so deftly, that he appeared\n",
      "to wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without\n",
      "a stagger.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up.\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side\n",
      "of the door, and shaking hands with every person individually\n",
      "as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas.\n",
      "When everybody had retired but the two 'prentices, they did\n",
      "the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away,\n",
      "and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a\n",
      "counter in the back-shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a\n",
      "man out of his wits. His heart and soul were in the scene,\n",
      "and with his former self. He corroborated everything,\n",
      "remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent\n",
      "the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the\n",
      "bright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from\n",
      "them, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious\n",
      "that it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its\n",
      "head burnt very clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A small matter,\" said the Ghost, \"to make these silly\n",
      "folks so full of gratitude.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Small!\" echoed Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices,\n",
      "who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig:\n",
      "and when he had done so, said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of\n",
      "your mortal money: three or four perhaps. Is that so\n",
      "much that he deserves this praise?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't that,\" said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and\n",
      "speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self.\n",
      "\"It isn't that, Spirit. He has the power to render us happy\n",
      "or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a\n",
      "pleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and\n",
      "looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is\n",
      "impossible to add and count 'em up: what then? The happiness\n",
      "he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt the Spirit's glance, and stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the matter?\" asked the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing particular,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Something, I think?\" the Ghost insisted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Scrooge, \"No. I should like to be able to say\n",
      "a word or two to my clerk just now. That's all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance\n",
      "to the wish; and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by\n",
      "side in the open air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My time grows short,\" observed the Spirit. \"Quick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he\n",
      "could see, but it produced an immediate effect. For again\n",
      "Scrooge saw himself. He was older now; a man in the prime\n",
      "of life. His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later\n",
      "years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice.\n",
      "There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which\n",
      "showed the passion that had taken root, and where the\n",
      "shadow of the growing tree would fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young\n",
      "girl in a mourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears,\n",
      "which sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of\n",
      "Christmas Past.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It matters little,\" she said, softly. \"To you, very little.\n",
      "Another idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort\n",
      "you in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have\n",
      "no just cause to grieve.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What Idol has displaced you?\" he rejoined.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A golden one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is the even-handed dealing of the world!\" he said.\n",
      "\"There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and\n",
      "there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity\n",
      "as the pursuit of wealth!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You fear the world too much,\" she answered, gently.\n",
      "\"All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being\n",
      "beyond the chance of its sordid reproach. I have seen your\n",
      "nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion,\n",
      "Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What then?\" he retorted. \"Even if I have grown so\n",
      "much wiser, what then? I am not changed towards you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Am I?\"\n",

      "hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than\n",
      "a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it\n",

      "It was his own room. There was no doubt about that.\n",

      "up the chimney, as that dull petrification of a hearth had\n",
      "never known in Scrooge's time, or Marley's, or for many and\n",
      "many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the floor, to form\n",

      "genial face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice,\n",
      "its unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded\n",

      "not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the\n",
      "pavement in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of\n",
      "their houses, whence it was mad delight to the boys to see\n",

      "which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by\n",
      "the heavy wheels of carts and waggons; furrows that crossed\n",
      "and re-crossed each other hundreds of times where the great\n",
      "streets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace\n",
      "in the thick yellow mud and icy water. The sky was gloomy,\n",
      "and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist,\n",
      "half thawed, half frozen, whose heavier particles descended\n",
      "in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all the chimneys in Great\n",
      "Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were blazing away\n",
      "to their dear hearts' content. There was nothing very cheerful\n",

      "snowball--better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest--\n",
      "laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it\n",
      "went wrong. The poulterers' shops were still half open, and the\n",
      "fruiterers' were radiant in their glory. There were great, round,\n",
      "pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats\n",
      "of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out\n",
      "into the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were\n",
      "ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in\n",
      "the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking\n",
      "from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went\n",
      "by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were\n",
      "pears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there\n",
      "were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers' benevolence\n",
      "to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people's mouths might\n",

      "and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among\n",
      "the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered\n",
      "leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting\n",
      "off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great\n",
      "compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and\n",
      "beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after\n",
      "dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth among\n",
      "these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and\n",
      "stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was\n",

      "The Grocers'! oh, the Grocers'! nearly closed, with perhaps\n",

      "counter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller\n",
      "parted company so briskly, or that the canisters were rattled\n",
      "up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended\n",
      "scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even\n",
      "that the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so\n",
      "extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight,\n",
      "the other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and\n",
      "spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on\n",

      "modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that\n",
      "everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but\n",
      "the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful\n",

      "at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left\n",
      "their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to\n",

      "the best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people\n",
      "were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which\n",
      "they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own,\n",
      "worn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws\n",
      "to peck at if they chose.\n",
      "\n",
      "But soon the steeples called good people all, to church and\n",
      "chapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in\n",
      "their best clothes, and with their gayest faces. And at the\n",
      "same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and\n",
      "nameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners\n",
      "to the bakers' shops. The sight of these poor revellers\n",
      "appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with\n",
      "Scrooge beside him in a baker's doorway, and taking off the\n",
      "covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their\n",
      "dinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon kind\n",
      "of torch, for once or twice when there were angry words\n",
      "between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he\n",
      "shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good\n",
      "humour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame\n",
      "to quarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love\n",
      "it, so it was!\n",
      "\n",
      "In time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and\n",
      "yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners\n",
      "and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of\n",
      "wet above each baker's oven; where the pavement smoked as\n",
      "if its stones were cooking too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from\n",
      "your torch?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is. My own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?\"\n",
      "asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To any kindly given. To a poor one most.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why to a poor one most?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because it needs it most.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit,\" said Scrooge, after a moment's thought, \"I wonder\n",
      "you, of all the beings in the many worlds about us, should\n",
      "desire to cramp these people's opportunities of innocent\n",
      "enjoyment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I!\" cried the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You would deprive them of their means of dining every\n",
      "seventh day, often the only day on which they can be said\n",
      "to dine at all,\" said Scrooge. \"Wouldn't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I!\" cried the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day?\" said\n",
      "Scrooge. \"And it comes to the same thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I seek!\" exclaimed the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your\n",
      "name, or at least in that of your family,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are some upon this earth of yours,\" returned the Spirit,\n",
      "\"who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion,\n",
      "pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness\n",
      "in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and\n",
      "kin, as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge\n",
      "their doings on themselves, not us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge promised that he would; and they went on,\n",
      "invisible, as they had been before, into the suburbs of the\n",
      "town. It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which\n",
      "Scrooge had observed at the baker's), that notwithstanding\n",
      "his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place\n",
      "with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as\n",
      "gracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible\n",
      "he could have done in any lofty hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in\n",
      "showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind,\n",
      "generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor\n",
      "men, that led him straight to Scrooge's clerk's; for there he\n",
      "went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and\n",
      "on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped\n",
      "to bless Bob Cratchit's dwelling with the sprinkling of his\n",
      "torch. Think of that! Bob had but fifteen \"Bob\" a-week\n",
      "himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his\n",
      "Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present\n",
      "blessed his four-roomed house!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out\n",
      "but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons,\n",
      "which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and\n",
      "she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of\n",
      "her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter\n",
      "Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and\n",
      "getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob's private\n",
      "property, conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the\n",
      "day) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly\n",
      "attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks.\n",
      "And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing\n",
      "in, screaming that outside the baker's they had smelt the\n",
      "goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious\n",
      "thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced\n",
      "about the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the\n",
      "skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked\n",
      "him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up,\n",
      "knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and\n",
      "peeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What has ever got your precious father then?\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Cratchit. \"And your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha\n",
      "warn't as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's Martha, mother!\" said a girl, appearing as she\n",
      "spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's Martha, mother!\" cried the two young Cratchits.\n",
      "\"Hurrah! There's such a goose, Martha!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!\"\n",
      "said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off\n",
      "her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'd a deal of work to finish up last night,\" replied the\n",
      "girl, \"and had to clear away this morning, mother!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well! Never mind so long as you are come,\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Cratchit. \"Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have\n",
      "a warm, Lord bless ye!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no! There's father coming,\" cried the two young\n",
      "Cratchits, who were everywhere at once. \"Hide, Martha,\n",
      "hide!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father,\n",
      "with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe,\n",
      "hanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned\n",
      "up and brushed, to look seasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his\n",
      "shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and\n",
      "had his limbs supported by an iron frame!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, where's our Martha?\" cried Bob Cratchit, looking\n",
      "round.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not coming,\" said Mrs. Cratchit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not coming!\" said Bob, with a sudden declension in his\n",
      "high spirits; for he had been Tim's blood horse all the way\n",
      "from church, and had come home rampant. \"Not coming\n",
      "upon Christmas Day!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Martha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only\n",
      "in joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet\n",
      "door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits\n",
      "hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash-house,\n",
      "that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And how did little Tim behave?\" asked Mrs. Cratchit,\n",
      "when she had rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had\n",
      "hugged his daughter to his heart's content.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As good as gold,\" said Bob, \"and better. Somehow he\n",
      "gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the\n",
      "strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home,\n",
      "that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he\n",
      "was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember\n",
      "upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind\n",
      "men see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and\n",
      "trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing\n",
      "strong and hearty.\n",
      "\n",
      "His active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back\n",
      "came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by\n",
      "his brother and sister to his stool before the fire; and while\n",
      "Bob, turning up his cuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were\n",
      "capable of being made more shabby--compounded some hot\n",
      "mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round\n",
      "and round and put it on the hob to simmer; Master Peter,\n",
      "and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the\n",
      "goose, with which they soon returned in high procession.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose\n",
      "the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a\n",
      "black swan was a matter of course--and in truth it was\n",
      "something very like it in that house. Mrs. Cratchit made\n",
      "the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot;\n",
      "Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour;\n",
      "Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted\n",
      "the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny\n",
      "corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for\n",
      "everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard\n",
      "upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\n",
      "they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be\n",
      "helped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was\n",
      "said. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs.\n",
      "Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared\n",
      "to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the\n",
      "long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of\n",
      "delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim,\n",
      "excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with\n",
      "the handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!\n",
      "\n",
      "There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe\n",
      "there ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and\n",
      "flavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal\n",
      "admiration. Eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes,\n",
      "it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as\n",
      "Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small\n",
      "atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at\n",
      "last! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest\n",
      "Cratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to\n",
      "the eyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss\n",
      "Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous to\n",
      "bear witnesses--to take the pudding up and bring it in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should\n",
      "break in turning out! Suppose somebody should have got\n",
      "over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they\n",
      "were merry with the goose--a supposition at which the two\n",
      "young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were\n",
      "supposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of\n",
      "the copper. A smell like a washing-day! That was the\n",
      "cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook's next\n",
      "door to each other, with a laundress's next door to that!\n",
      "That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit\n",
      "entered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding,\n",
      "like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half\n",
      "of half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with\n",
      "Christmas holly stuck into the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly\n",
      "too, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by\n",
      "Mrs. Cratchit since their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that\n",
      "now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had\n",
      "had her doubts about the quantity of flour. Everybody had\n",
      "something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\n",
      "was at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have\n",
      "been flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed\n",
      "to hint at such a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the\n",
      "hearth swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the\n",
      "jug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges\n",
      "were put upon the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts on the\n",
      "fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth, in\n",
      "what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and\n",
      "at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.\n",
      "Two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.\n",
      "\n",
      "These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as\n",
      "golden goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with\n",
      "beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and\n",
      "cracked noisily. Then Bob proposed:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Which all the family re-echoed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God bless us every one!\" said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat very close to his father's side upon his little\n",
      "stool. Bob held his withered little hand in his, as if he\n",
      "loved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and\n",
      "dreaded that he might be taken from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit,\" said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt\n",
      "before, \"tell me if Tiny Tim will live.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see a vacant seat,\" replied the Ghost, \"in the poor\n",
      "chimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully\n",
      "preserved. If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future,\n",
      "the child will die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no,\" said Scrooge. \"Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he\n",
      "will be spared.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none\n",
      "other of my race,\" returned the Ghost, \"will find him here.\n",
      "What then? If he be like to die, he had better do it, and\n",
      "decrease the surplus population.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by\n",
      "the Spirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Man,\" said the Ghost, \"if man you be in heart, not\n",
      "adamant, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered\n",
      "What the surplus is, and Where it is. Will you decide what\n",
      "men shall live, what men shall die? It may be, that in the\n",
      "sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live\n",
      "than millions like this poor man's child. Oh God! to hear\n",
      "the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life\n",
      "among his hungry brothers in the dust!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke, and trembling cast\n",
      "his eyes upon the ground. But he raised them speedily, on\n",
      "hearing his own name.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Scrooge!\" said Bob; \"I'll give you Mr. Scrooge, the\n",
      "Founder of the Feast!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Founder of the Feast indeed!\" cried Mrs. Cratchit,\n",
      "reddening. \"I wish I had him here. I'd give him a piece\n",
      "of my mind to feast upon, and I hope he'd have a good\n",
      "appetite for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear,\" said Bob, \"the children! Christmas Day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,\" said she, \"on\n",
      "which one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard,\n",
      "unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge. You know he is, Robert!\n",
      "Nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear,\" was Bob's mild answer, \"Christmas Day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll drink his health for your sake and the Day's,\" said\n",
      "Mrs. Cratchit, \"not for his. Long life to him! A merry\n",
      "Christmas and a happy new year! He'll be very merry and\n",
      "very happy, I have no doubt!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The children drank the toast after her. It was the first of\n",
      "their proceedings which had no heartiness. Tiny Tim drank\n",
      "it last of all, but he didn't care twopence for it. Scrooge\n",
      "was the Ogre of the family. The mention of his name cast\n",
      "a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full\n",
      "five minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "After it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than\n",
      "before, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done\n",
      "with. Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his\n",
      "eye for Master Peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full\n",
      "five-and-sixpence weekly. The two young Cratchits laughed\n",
      "tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man of business;\n",
      "and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from\n",
      "between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular\n",
      "investments he should favour when he came into the receipt\n",
      "of that bewildering income. Martha, who was a poor\n",
      "apprentice at a milliner's, then told them what kind of work\n",
      "she had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch,\n",
      "and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a\n",
      "good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at\n",
      "home. Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some\n",
      "days before, and how the lord \"was much about as tall as\n",
      "Peter;\" at which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you\n",
      "couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All this\n",
      "time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and\n",
      "by-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in\n",
      "the snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice,\n",
      "and sang it very well indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing of high mark in this. They were not\n",
      "a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes\n",
      "were far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty;\n",
      "and Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside\n",
      "of a pawnbroker's. But, they were happy, grateful, pleased\n",
      "with one another, and contented with the time; and when\n",
      "they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings\n",
      "of the Spirit's torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon\n",
      "them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty\n",
      "heavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets,\n",
      "the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and\n",
      "all sorts of rooms, was wonderful. Here, the flickering of\n",
      "the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot\n",
      "plates baking through and through before the fire, and deep\n",
      "red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.\n",
      "There all the children of the house were running out\n",
      "into the snow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins,\n",
      "uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them. Here, again,\n",
      "were shadows on the window-blind of guests assembling; and\n",
      "there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted,\n",
      "and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\n",
      "neighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw\n",
      "them enter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!\n",
      "\n",
      "But, if you had judged from the numbers of people on\n",
      "their way to friendly gatherings, you might have thought\n",
      "that no one was at home to give them welcome when they\n",
      "got there, instead of every house expecting company, and\n",
      "piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\n",
      "the Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and\n",
      "opened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with\n",
      "a generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything\n",
      "within its reach! The very lamplighter, who ran on before,\n",
      "dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was\n",
      "dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly\n",
      "as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter\n",
      "that he had any company but Christmas!\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they\n",
      "stood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses\n",
      "of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place\n",
      "of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed,\n",
      "or would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner;\n",
      "and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass.\n",
      "Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\n",
      "red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a\n",
      "sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in\n",
      "the thick gloom of darkest night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What place is this?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels of\n",
      "the earth,\" returned the Spirit. \"But they know me. See!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they\n",
      "advanced towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and\n",
      "stone, they found a cheerful company assembled round a\n",
      "glowing fire. An old, old man and woman, with their\n",
      "children and their children's children, and another generation\n",
      "beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\n",
      "The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling\n",
      "of the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a\n",
      "Christmas song--it had been a very old song when he was a\n",
      "boy--and from time to time they all joined in the chorus.\n",
      "So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite\n",
      "blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour\n",
      "sank again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his\n",
      "robe, and passing on above the moor, sped--whither? Not\n",
      "to sea? To sea. To Scrooge's horror, looking back, he saw\n",
      "the last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them;\n",
      "and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it\n",
      "rolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it\n",
      "had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league\n",
      "or so from shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed,\n",
      "the wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse.\n",
      "Great heaps of sea-weed clung to its base, and storm-birds\n",
      "--born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-weed of the\n",
      "water--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even here, two men who watched the light had made\n",
      "a fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed\n",
      "out a ray of brightness on the awful sea. Joining their\n",
      "horny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they\n",
      "wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog; and\n",
      "one of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged and\n",
      "scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship\n",
      "might be: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in\n",
      "itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea\n",
      "--on, on--until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any\n",
      "shore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman\n",
      "at the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who\n",
      "had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations;\n",
      "but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\n",
      "had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his\n",
      "companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward\n",
      "hopes belonging to it. And every man on board, waking or\n",
      "sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another\n",
      "on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared\n",
      "to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those\n",
      "he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted\n",
      "to remember him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the\n",
      "moaning of the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it\n",
      "was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown\n",
      "abyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as Death: it\n",
      "was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, to hear\n",
      "a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge\n",
      "to recognise it as his own nephew's and to find himself in a\n",
      "bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling\n",
      "by his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving\n",
      "affability!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ha, ha!\" laughed Scrooge's nephew. \"Ha, ha, ha!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a\n",
      "man more blest in a laugh than Scrooge's nephew, all I can\n",
      "say is, I should like to know him too. Introduce him to me,\n",
      "and I'll cultivate his acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that\n",
      "while there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing\n",
      "in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and\n",
      "good-humour. When Scrooge's nephew laughed in this way: holding\n",
      "his sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the\n",
      "most extravagant contortions: Scrooge's niece, by marriage,\n",
      "laughed as heartily as he. And their assembled friends being\n",
      "not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!\" cried\n",
      "Scrooge's nephew. \"He believed it too!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"More shame for him, Fred!\" said Scrooge's niece,\n",
      "indignantly. Bless those women; they never do anything by\n",
      "halves. They are always in earnest.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was very pretty: exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled,\n",
      "surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that\n",
      "seemed made to be kissed--as no doubt it was; all kinds of\n",
      "good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another\n",
      "when she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever\n",
      "saw in any little creature's head. Altogether she was what\n",
      "you would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory, too.\n",
      "Oh, perfectly satisfactory.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's a comical old fellow,\" said Scrooge's nephew, \"that's\n",
      "the truth: and not so pleasant as he might be. However,\n",
      "his offences carry their own punishment, and I have nothing\n",
      "to say against him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sure he is very rich, Fred,\" hinted Scrooge's niece.\n",
      "\"At least you always tell me so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What of that, my dear!\" said Scrooge's nephew. \"His\n",
      "wealth is of no use to him. He don't do any good with it.\n",
      "He don't make himself comfortable with it. He hasn't the\n",
      "satisfaction of thinking--ha, ha, ha!--that he is ever going\n",
      "to benefit US with it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have no patience with him,\" observed Scrooge's niece.\n",
      "Scrooge's niece's sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed\n",
      "the same opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I have!\" said Scrooge's nephew. \"I am sorry for\n",
      "him; I couldn't be angry with him if I tried. Who suffers\n",
      "by his ill whims! Himself, always. Here, he takes it into\n",
      "his head to dislike us, and he won't come and dine with us.\n",
      "What's the consequence? He don't lose much of a dinner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,\" interrupted\n",
      "Scrooge's niece. Everybody else said the same, and they\n",
      "must be allowed to have been competent judges, because\n",
      "they had just had dinner; and, with the dessert upon the\n",
      "table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well! I'm very glad to hear it,\" said Scrooge's nephew,\n",
      "\"because I haven't great faith in these young housekeepers.\n",
      "What do you say, Topper?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge's niece's\n",
      "sisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast,\n",
      "who had no right to express an opinion on the subject.\n",
      "Whereat Scrooge's niece's sister--the plump one with the lace\n",
      "tucker: not the one with the roses--blushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do go on, Fred,\" said Scrooge's niece, clapping her hands.\n",
      "\"He never finishes what he begins to say! He is such a\n",
      "ridiculous fellow!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge's nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was\n",
      "impossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister\n",
      "tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was\n",
      "unanimously followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was only going to say,\" said Scrooge's nephew, \"that\n",
      "the consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making\n",
      "merry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant\n",
      "moments, which could do him no harm. I am sure he loses\n",
      "pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts,\n",
      "either in his mouldy old office, or his dusty chambers. I\n",
      "mean to give him the same chance every year, whether he\n",
      "likes it or not, for I pity him. He may rail at Christmas\n",
      "till he dies, but he can't help thinking better of it--I defy\n",
      "him--if he finds me going there, in good temper, year after\n",
      "year, and saying Uncle Scrooge, how are you? If it only\n",
      "puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds,\n",
      "that's something; and I think I shook him yesterday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking\n",
      "Scrooge. But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much\n",
      "caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any\n",
      "rate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the\n",
      "bottle joyously.\n",
      "\n",
      "After tea, they had some music. For they were a musical\n",
      "family, and knew what they were about, when they sung a\n",
      "Glee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper, who\n",
      "could growl away in the bass like a good one, and never\n",
      "swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face\n",
      "over it. Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and\n",
      "played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing:\n",
      "you might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had\n",
      "been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the\n",
      "boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of\n",
      "Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the\n",
      "things that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he\n",
      "softened more and more; and thought that if he could have\n",
      "listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the\n",
      "kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands,\n",
      "without resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob\n",
      "Marley.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After\n",
      "a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children\n",
      "sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its\n",
      "mighty Founder was a child himself. Stop! There was first\n",
      "a game at blind-man's buff. Of course there was. And I\n",
      "no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he\n",
      "had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done\n",
      "thing between him and Scrooge's nephew; and that the\n",
      "Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after\n",
      "that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the\n",
      "credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons,\n",
      "tumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano,\n",
      "smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went,\n",
      "there went he! He always knew where the plump sister was.\n",
      "He wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had fallen up\n",
      "against him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would\n",
      "have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would\n",
      "have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly\n",
      "have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister.\n",
      "She often cried out that it wasn't fair; and it really was not.\n",
      "But when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her\n",
      "silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got\n",
      "her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his\n",
      "conduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not to\n",
      "know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her\n",
      "head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by\n",
      "pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain\n",
      "about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told\n",
      "him her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in\n",
      "office, they were so very confidential together, behind the\n",
      "curtains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge's niece was not one of the blind-man's buff party,\n",
      "but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool,\n",
      "in a snug corner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close\n",
      "behind her. But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her\n",
      "love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet.\n",
      "Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was\n",
      "very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat\n",
      "her sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper\n",
      "could have told you. There might have been twenty people there,\n",
      "young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for\n",
      "wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that\n",
      "his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with\n",
      "his guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too;\n",
      "for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut\n",
      "in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in\n",
      "his head to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood,\n",
      "and looked upon him with such favour, that he begged like\n",
      "a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed. But\n",
      "this the Spirit said could not be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here is a new game,\" said Scrooge. \"One half hour,\n",
      "Spirit, only one!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew\n",
      "had to think of something, and the rest must find out what;\n",
      "he only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case\n",
      "was. The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed,\n",
      "elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live\n",
      "animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an\n",
      "animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes,\n",
      "and lived in London, and walked about the streets,\n",
      "and wasn't made a show of, and wasn't led by anybody, and\n",
      "didn't live in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market,\n",
      "and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a\n",
      "tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every fresh\n",
      "question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a\n",
      "fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that\n",
      "he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp. At last\n",
      "the plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know\n",
      "what it is!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it?\" cried Fred.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Which it certainly was. Admiration was the universal\n",
      "sentiment, though some objected that the reply to \"Is it a\n",
      "bear?\" ought to have been \"Yes;\" inasmuch as an answer\n",
      "in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts\n",
      "from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency\n",
      "that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure,\" said\n",
      "Fred, \"and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health.\n",

      "\"Well! Uncle Scrooge!\" they cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old\n",

      "Scrooge!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light\n",
      "of heart, that he would have pledged the unconscious\n",
      "company in return, and thanked them in an inaudible speech,\n",
      "if the Ghost had given him time. But the whole scene\n",
      "passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his\n",
      "nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they\n",
      "visited, but always with a happy end. The Spirit stood\n",
      "beside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign lands,\n",
      "and they were close at home; by struggling men, and they\n",
      "were patient in their greater hope; by poverty, and it was\n",
      "rich. In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery's every\n",
      "refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not\n",
      "made fast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his\n",
      "blessing, and taught Scrooge his precepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge\n",
      "had his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared\n",
      "to be condensed into the space of time they passed\n",
      "together. It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained\n",
      "unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly\n",
      "older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of\n",
      "it, until they left a children's Twelfth Night party, when,\n",
      "looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place,\n",
      "he noticed that its hair was grey.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are spirits' lives so short?\" asked Scrooge.\n",

      "Scrooge, looking intently at the Spirit's robe, \"but I see\n",

      "touched them with its freshest tints, a stale and shrivelled\n",
      "hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and\n",

      "\"Spirit! are they yours?\" Scrooge could say no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are Man's,\" said the Spirit, looking down upon\n",
      "them. \"And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers.\n",
      "This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both,\n",
      "and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for\n",
      "on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the\n",
      "writing be erased. Deny it!\" cried the Spirit, stretching out\n",
      "its hand towards the city. \"Slander those who tell it ye!\n",
      "Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse.\n",
      "And bide the end!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have they no refuge or resource?\" cried Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are there no prisons?\" said the Spirit, turning on him\n",
      "for the last time with his own words. \"Are there no workhouses?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The bell struck twelve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not.\n",
      "As the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the\n",
      "prediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting up his eyes,\n",
      "beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like\n",
      "a mist along the ground, towards him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "STAVE IV:  THE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n",
      "\n",
      "THE Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. When\n",
      "it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in\n",
      "the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to\n",
      "scatter gloom and mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed\n",
      "its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible\n",
      "save one outstretched hand. But for this it would have been\n",
      "difficult to detach its figure from the night, and separate it\n",
      "from the darkness by which it was surrounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside\n",
      "him, and that its mysterious presence filled him with a\n",
      "solemn dread. He knew no more, for the Spirit neither\n",
      "spoke nor moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To\n",
      "Come?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its\n",
      "hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are about to show me shadows of the things that\n",
      "have not happened, but will happen in the time before us,\"\n",
      "Scrooge pursued. \"Is that so, Spirit?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The upper portion of the garment was contracted for an\n",
      "instant in its folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head.\n",
      "That was the only answer he received.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although well used to ghostly company by this time,\n",
      "Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled\n",
      "beneath him, and he found that he could hardly stand when\n",
      "he prepared to follow it. The Spirit paused a moment, as\n",
      "observing his condition, and giving him time to recover.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him\n",
      "with a vague uncertain horror, to know that behind the\n",
      "dusky shroud, there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon\n",
      "him, while he, though he stretched his own to the utmost,\n",
      "could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap\n",
      "of black.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ghost of the Future!\" he exclaimed, \"I fear you more\n",
      "than any spectre I have seen. But as I know your purpose\n",
      "is to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another\n",
      "man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you company,\n",
      "and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak\n",
      "to me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight\n",
      "before them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lead on!\" said Scrooge. \"Lead on! The night is\n",
      "waning fast, and it is precious time to me, I know. Lead\n",
      "on, Spirit!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Phantom moved away as it had come towards him.\n",

      "up, he thought, and carried him along.\n",
      "\n",
      "They scarcely seemed to enter the city; for the city rather\n",
      "seemed to spring up about them, and encompass them of its\n",
      "own act. But there they were, in the heart of it; on\n",
      "'Change, amongst the merchants; who hurried up and down,\n",
      "and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in\n",
      "groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully\n",
      "with their great gold seals; and so forth, as Scrooge had\n",
      "seen them often.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men.\n",
      "Observing that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge\n",
      "advanced to listen to their talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, \"I\n",

      "dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When did he die?\" inquired another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Last night, I believe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, what was the matter with him?\" asked a third,\n",

      "\"I thought he'd never die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God knows,\" said the first, with a yawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What has he done with his money?\" asked a red-faced\n",
      "gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his\n",
      "nose, that shook like the gills of a turkey-cock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't heard,\" said the man with the large chin,\n",
      "yawning again. \"Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn't\n",
      "left it to me. That's all I know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This pleasantry was received with a general laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's likely to be a very cheap funeral,\" said the same\n",
      "speaker; \"for upon my life I don't know of anybody to go\n",
      "to it. Suppose we make up a party and volunteer?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't mind going if a lunch is provided,\" observed the\n",
      "gentleman with the excrescence on his nose. \"But I must\n",

      "\n",
      "Another laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,\"\n",
      "said the first speaker, \"for I never wear black gloves, and I\n",
      "never eat lunch. But I'll offer to go, if anybody else will.\n",
      "When I come to think of it, I'm not at all sure that I wasn't\n",
      "his most particular friend; for we used to stop and speak\n",
      "whenever we met. Bye, bye!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Speakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with\n",
      "other groups. Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the\n",
      "Spirit for an explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed\n",
      "to two persons meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking\n",
      "that the explanation might lie here.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business:\n",
      "very wealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point\n",
      "always of standing well in their esteem: in a business point\n",
      "of view, that is; strictly in a business point of view.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How are you?\" said one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How are you?\" returned the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well!\" said the first. \"Old Scratch has got his own at\n",
      "last, hey?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I am told,\" returned the second. \"Cold, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seasonable for Christmas time. You're not a skater, I\n",
      "suppose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. No. Something else to think of. Good morning!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Not another word. That was their meeting, their\n",
      "conversation, and their parting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the\n",
      "Spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so\n",
      "trivial; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden\n",
      "purpose, he set himself to consider what it was likely to be.\n",
      "They could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the\n",
      "death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was Past, and this\n",
      "Ghost's province was the Future. Nor could he think of any\n",
      "one immediately connected with himself, to whom he could\n",
      "apply them. But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they\n",
      "applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement,\n",
      "he resolved to treasure up every word he heard,\n",
      "and everything he saw; and especially to observe the\n",
      "shadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation\n",
      "that the conduct of his future self would give him\n",
      "the clue he missed, and would render the solution of these\n",
      "riddles easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked about in that very place for his own image; but\n",
      "another man stood in his accustomed corner, and though the\n",
      "clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he\n",
      "saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured\n",
      "in through the Porch. It gave him little surprise, however;\n",
      "for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life, and\n",
      "thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried\n",
      "out in this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its\n",
      "outstretched hand. When he roused himself from his\n",
      "thoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand, and\n",
      "its situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes\n",
      "were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder, and feel\n",
      "very cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part\n",
      "of the town, where Scrooge had never penetrated before,\n",
      "although he recognised its situation, and its bad repute. The\n",
      "ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched;\n",
      "the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly. Alleys and\n",
      "archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of\n",
      "smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the\n",
      "whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Far in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed,\n",
      "beetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags,\n",
      "bottles, bones, and greasy offal, were bought. Upon the floor\n",
      "within, were piled up heaps of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges,\n",
      "files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds. Secrets\n",
      "that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in\n",
      "mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and\n",
      "sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a\n",
      "charcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal,\n",
      "nearly seventy years of age; who had screened himself from the\n",
      "cold air without, by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous\n",
      "tatters, hung upon a line; and smoked his pipe in all the luxury\n",
      "of calm retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this\n",
      "man, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the\n",
      "shop. But she had scarcely entered, when another woman,\n",
      "similarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by\n",
      "a man in faded black, who was no less startled by the sight\n",
      "of them, than they had been upon the recognition of each\n",
      "other. After a short period of blank astonishment, in which\n",
      "the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all three\n",
      "burst into a laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let the charwoman alone to be the first!\" cried she who\n",
      "had entered first. \"Let the laundress alone to be the second;\n",
      "and let the undertaker's man alone to be the third. Look\n",
      "here, old Joe, here's a chance! If we haven't all three met\n",
      "here without meaning it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You couldn't have met in a better place,\" said old Joe,\n",
      "removing his pipe from his mouth. \"Come into the parlour.\n",
      "You were made free of it long ago, you know; and the other\n",
      "two an't strangers. Stop till I shut the door of the shop.\n",
      "Ah! How it skreeks! There an't such a rusty bit of metal\n",
      "in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I'm sure there's\n",
      "no such old bones here, as mine. Ha, ha! We're all suitable\n",
      "to our calling, we're well matched. Come into the\n",
      "parlour. Come into the parlour.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The\n",
      "old man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and\n",
      "having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night), with the\n",
      "stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth again.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he did this, the woman who had already spoken\n",
      "threw her bundle on the floor, and sat down in a flaunting\n",
      "manner on a stool; crossing her elbows on her knees, and\n",
      "looking with a bold defiance at the other two.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What odds then! What odds, Mrs. Dilber?\" said the\n",
      "woman. \"Every person has a right to take care of themselves.\n",
      "He always did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's true, indeed!\" said the laundress. \"No man\n",
      "more so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why then, don't stand staring as if you was afraid,\n",
      "woman; who's the wiser? We're not going to pick holes in\n",
      "each other's coats, I suppose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed!\" said Mrs. Dilber and the man together.\n",
      "\"We should hope not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, then!\" cried the woman. \"That's enough.\n",
      "Who's the worse for the loss of a few things like these?\n",
      "Not a dead man, I suppose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed,\" said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead, a wicked old\n",
      "screw,\" pursued the woman, \"why wasn't he natural in his\n",
      "lifetime? If he had been, he'd have had somebody to look\n",
      "after him when he was struck with Death, instead of lying\n",
      "gasping out his last there, alone by himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the truest word that ever was spoke,\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Dilber. \"It's a judgment on him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish it was a little heavier judgment,\" replied the\n",
      "woman; \"and it should have been, you may depend upon it,\n",
      "if I could have laid my hands on anything else. Open that\n",
      "bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it. Speak out\n",
      "plain. I'm not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to\n",
      "see it. We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves,\n",
      "before we met here, I believe. It's no sin. Open the bundle,\n",
      "Joe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this;\n",
      "and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first,\n",
      "produced his plunder. It was not extensive. A seal or two,\n",
      "a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no\n",
      "great value, were all. They were severally examined and\n",
      "appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed\n",
      "to give for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a\n",
      "total when he found there was nothing more to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's your account,\" said Joe, \"and I wouldn't give\n",
      "another sixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it.\n",
      "Who's next?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing\n",
      "apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of\n",
      "sugar-tongs, and a few boots. Her account was stated on the wall\n",
      "in the same manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I always give too much to ladies. It's a weakness of mine,\n",
      "and that's the way I ruin myself,\" said old Joe. \"That's\n",
      "your account. If you asked me for another penny, and made\n",
      "it an open question, I'd repent of being so liberal and knock\n",
      "off half-a-crown.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now undo my bundle, Joe,\" said the first woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience\n",
      "of opening it, and having unfastened a great many knots,\n",
      "dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you call this?\" said Joe. \"Bed-curtains!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward\n",
      "on her crossed arms. \"Bed-curtains!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't mean to say you took 'em down, rings and\n",
      "all, with him lying there?\" said Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes I do,\" replied the woman. \"Why not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You were born to make your fortune,\" said Joe, \"and\n",
      "you'll certainly do it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I certainly shan't hold my hand, when I can get anything\n",
      "in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He\n",
      "was, I promise you, Joe,\" returned the woman coolly. \"Don't\n",
      "drop that oil upon the blankets, now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His blankets?\" asked Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whose else's do you think?\" replied the woman. \"He\n",
      "isn't likely to take cold without 'em, I dare say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope he didn't die of anything catching? Eh?\" said\n",
      "old Joe, stopping in his work, and looking up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you be afraid of that,\" returned the woman. \"I\n",
      "an't so fond of his company that I'd loiter about him for\n",
      "such things, if he did. Ah! you may look through that\n",
      "shirt till your eyes ache; but you won't find a hole in it, nor\n",
      "a threadbare place. It's the best he had, and a fine one too.\n",
      "They'd have wasted it, if it hadn't been for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you call wasting of it?\" asked old Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,\" replied\n",
      "the woman with a laugh. \"Somebody was fool enough to\n",
      "do it, but I took it off again. If calico an't good enough for\n",
      "such a purpose, it isn't good enough for anything. It's quite\n",
      "as becoming to the body. He can't look uglier than he did\n",
      "in that one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat\n",
      "grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by\n",
      "the old man's lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and\n",
      "disgust, which could hardly have been greater, though they\n",
      "had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ha, ha!\" laughed the same woman, when old Joe,\n",
      "producing a flannel bag with money in it, told out their\n",
      "several gains upon the ground. \"This is the end of it, you\n",
      "see! He frightened every one away from him when he was\n",
      "alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit!\" said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. \"I\n",
      "see, I see. The case of this unhappy man might be my own.\n",
      "My life tends that way, now. Merciful Heaven, what is\n",
      "this!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now\n",
      "he almost touched a bed: a bare, uncurtained bed: on which,\n",
      "beneath a ragged sheet, there lay a something covered up,\n",
      "which, though it was dumb, announced itself in awful\n",
      "language.\n",
      "\n",
      "The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with\n",
      "any accuracy, though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience\n",
      "to a secret impulse, anxious to know what kind of room it\n",
      "was. A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon\n",
      "the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept,\n",
      "uncared for, was the body of this man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand\n",
      "was pointed to the head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted\n",
      "that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon\n",
      "Scrooge's part, would have disclosed the face. He thought\n",
      "of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to do it;\n",
      "but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss\n",
      "the spectre at his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar\n",
      "here, and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy\n",
      "command: for this is thy dominion! But of the loved,\n",
      "revered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair\n",
      "to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is\n",
      "not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released;\n",
      "it is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the\n",
      "hand WAS open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm,\n",
      "and tender; and the pulse a man's. Strike, Shadow, strike!\n",
      "And see his good deeds springing from the wound, to sow\n",
      "the world with life immortal!\n",
      "\n",
      "No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and\n",
      "yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed. He\n",
      "thought, if this man could be raised up now, what would be\n",
      "his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard-dealing, griping cares?\n",
      "They have brought him to a rich end, truly!\n",
      "\n",
      "He lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a\n",
      "woman, or a child, to say that he was kind to me in this\n",
      "or that, and for the memory of one kind word I will be\n",
      "kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was\n",
      "a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone. What\n",
      "they wanted in the room of death, and why they were so\n",
      "restless and disturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit!\" he said, \"this is a fearful place. In leaving it,\n",
      "I shall not leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the\n",
      "head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I understand you,\" Scrooge returned, \"and I would do\n",
      "it, if I could. But I have not the power, Spirit. I have\n",
      "not the power.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again it seemed to look upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion\n",
      "caused by this man's death,\" said Scrooge quite agonised,\n",
      "\"show that person to me, Spirit, I beseech you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a\n",
      "moment, like a wing; and withdrawing it, revealed a room\n",
      "by daylight, where a mother and her children were.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness;\n",
      "for she walked up and down the room; started at every\n",
      "sound; looked out from the window; glanced at the clock;\n",
      "tried, but in vain, to work with her needle; and could hardly\n",
      "bear the voices of the children in their play.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried\n",
      "to the door, and met her husband; a man whose face was\n",
      "careworn and depressed, though he was young. There was\n",
      "a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of serious delight\n",
      "of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to repress.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for\n",
      "him by the fire; and when she asked him faintly what news\n",
      "(which was not until after a long silence), he appeared\n",
      "embarrassed how to answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it good?\" she said, \"or bad?\"--to help him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bad,\" he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are quite ruined?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. There is hope yet, Caroline.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he relents,\" she said, amazed, \"there is! Nothing is\n",
      "past hope, if such a miracle has happened.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is past relenting,\" said her husband. \"He is dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke\n",
      "truth; but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she\n",
      "said so, with clasped hands. She prayed forgiveness the next\n",
      "moment, and was sorry; but the first was the emotion of\n",
      "her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last\n",
      "night, said to me, when I tried to see him and obtain a\n",
      "week's delay; and what I thought was a mere excuse to avoid\n",
      "me; turns out to have been quite true. He was not only\n",
      "very ill, but dying, then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To whom will our debt be transferred?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know. But before that time we shall be ready\n",
      "with the money; and even though we were not, it would be\n",
      "a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his\n",
      "successor. We may sleep to-night with light hearts, Caroline!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter.\n",
      "The children's faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what\n",
      "they so little understood, were brighter; and it was a happier\n",
      "house for this man's death! The only emotion that the\n",
      "Ghost could show him, caused by the event, was one of\n",
      "pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,\" said\n",
      "Scrooge; \"or that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just\n",
      "now, will be for ever present to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar\n",
      "to his feet; and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and\n",
      "there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen. They\n",
      "entered poor Bob Cratchit's house; the dwelling he had\n",
      "visited before; and found the mother and the children seated\n",
      "round the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as\n",
      "still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter,\n",
      "who had a book before him. The mother and her daughters\n",
      "were engaged in sewing. But surely they were very quiet!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'And He took a child, and set him in the midst of\n",
      "them.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Where had Scrooge heard those words? He had not\n",
      "dreamed them. The boy must have read them out, as he\n",
      "and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why did he not\n",
      "go on?\n",
      "\n",
      "The mother laid her work upon the table, and put her\n",
      "hand up to her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The colour hurts my eyes,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They're better now again,\" said Cratchit's wife. \"It\n",
      "makes them weak by candle-light; and I wouldn't show weak\n",
      "eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world. It\n",
      "must be near his time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Past it rather,\" Peter answered, shutting up his book.\n",
      "\"But I think he has walked a little slower than he used,\n",
      "these few last evenings, mother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a\n",
      "steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have known him walk with--I have known him walk\n",
      "with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so have I,\" cried Peter. \"Often.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so have I,\" exclaimed another. So had all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But he was very light to carry,\" she resumed, intent upon\n",
      "her work, \"and his father loved him so, that it was no\n",
      "trouble: no trouble. And there is your father at the door!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter\n",
      "--he had need of it, poor fellow--came in. His tea\n",
      "was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should\n",
      "help him to it most. Then the two young Cratchits got\n",
      "upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against\n",
      "his face, as if they said, \"Don't mind it, father. Don't be\n",
      "grieved!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to\n",
      "all the family. He looked at the work upon the table, and\n",
      "praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls.\n",
      "They would be done long before Sunday, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?\" said his\n",
      "wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, my dear,\" returned Bob. \"I wish you could have\n",
      "gone. It would have done you good to see how green a\n",
      "place it is. But you'll see it often. I promised him that I\n",
      "would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little child!\"\n",
      "cried Bob. \"My little child!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He broke down all at once. He couldn't help it. If he\n",
      "could have helped it, he and his child would have been farther\n",
      "apart perhaps than they were.\n",
      "\n",
      "He left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above,\n",
      "which was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas.\n",
      "There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were\n",
      "signs of some one having been there, lately. Poor Bob sat\n",
      "down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed\n",
      "himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what\n",
      "had happened, and went down again quite happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "They drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother\n",
      "working still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness\n",
      "of Mr. Scrooge's nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but\n",
      "once, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and seeing\n",
      "that he looked a little--\"just a little down you know,\" said\n",
      "Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him. \"On\n",
      "which,\" said Bob, \"for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman\n",
      "you ever heard, I told him. 'I am heartily sorry for it, Mr.\n",
      "Cratchit,' he said, 'and heartily sorry for your good wife.'\n",
      "By the bye, how he ever knew that, I don't know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Knew what, my dear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, that you were a good wife,\" replied Bob.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everybody knows that!\" said Peter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well observed, my boy!\" cried Bob. \"I hope they\n",
      "do. 'Heartily sorry,' he said, 'for your good wife. If I\n",
      "can be of service to you in any way,' he said, giving me\n",
      "his card, 'that's where I live. Pray come to me.' Now, it\n",
      "wasn't,\" cried Bob, \"for the sake of anything he might be\n",
      "able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was\n",
      "quite delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our\n",
      "Tiny Tim, and felt with us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sure he's a good soul!\" said Mrs. Cratchit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You would be surer of it, my dear,\" returned Bob, \"if\n",
      "you saw and spoke to him. I shouldn't be at all surprised--\n",
      "mark what I say!--if he got Peter a better situation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only hear that, Peter,\" said Mrs. Cratchit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And then,\" cried one of the girls, \"Peter will be keeping\n",
      "company with some one, and setting up for himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get along with you!\" retorted Peter, grinning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's just as likely as not,\" said Bob, \"one of these days;\n",
      "though there's plenty of time for that, my dear. But however\n",
      "and whenever we part from one another, I am sure we\n",
      "shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim--shall we--or this\n",
      "first parting that there was among us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never, father!\" cried they all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I know,\" said Bob, \"I know, my dears, that when\n",
      "we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he\n",
      "was a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among\n",
      "ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, never, father!\" they all cried again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very happy,\" said little Bob, \"I am very happy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the\n",
      "two young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook\n",
      "hands. Spirit of Tiny Tim, thy childish essence was from\n",
      "God!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spectre,\" said Scrooge, \"something informs me that our\n",
      "parting moment is at hand. I know it, but I know not\n",
      "how. Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as\n",
      "before--though at a different time, he thought: indeed, there\n",
      "seemed no order in these latter visions, save that they were\n",
      "in the Future--into the resorts of business men, but showed\n",
      "him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for anything,\n",
      "but went straight on, as to the end just now desired,\n",
      "until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This court,\" said Scrooge, \"through which we hurry now,\n",
      "is where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length\n",
      "of time. I see the house. Let me behold what I shall be,\n",
      "in days to come!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The house is yonder,\" Scrooge exclaimed. \"Why do you\n",
      "point away?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The inexorable finger underwent no change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked\n",
      "in. It was an office still, but not his. The furniture was\n",
      "not the same, and the figure in the chair was not himself.\n",
      "The Phantom pointed as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "He joined it once again, and wondering why and whither\n",
      "he had gone, accompanied it until they reached an iron gate.\n",
      "He paused to look round before entering.\n",
      "\n",
      "A churchyard. Here, then; the wretched man whose name\n",
      "he had now to learn, lay underneath the ground. It was a\n",
      "worthy place. Walled in by houses; overrun by grass and\n",
      "weeds, the growth of vegetation's death, not life; choked up\n",
      "with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A\n",
      "worthy place!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to\n",
      "One. He advanced towards it trembling. The Phantom was\n",
      "exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new\n",
      "meaning in its solemn shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,\"\n",
      "said Scrooge, \"answer me one question. Are these the\n",
      "shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of\n",
      "things that May be, only?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which\n",
      "it stood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if\n",
      "persevered in, they must lead,\" said Scrooge. \"But if the\n",
      "courses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is\n",
      "thus with what you show me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit was immovable as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and\n",
      "following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected\n",
      "grave his own name, EBENEZER SCROOGE.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Am I that man who lay upon the bed?\" he cried, upon\n",
      "his knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Spirit! Oh no, no!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The finger still was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit!\" he cried, tight clutching at its robe, \"hear me!\n",
      "I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must\n",
      "have been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, if I\n",
      "am past all hope!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time the hand appeared to shake.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good Spirit,\" he pursued, as down upon the ground he\n",
      "fell before it: \"Your nature intercedes for me, and pities\n",
      "me. Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you\n",
      "have shown me, by an altered life!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The kind hand trembled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it\n",
      "all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the\n",
      "Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I\n",
      "will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I\n",
      "may sponge away the writing on this stone!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In his agony, he caught the spectral hand. It sought to\n",
      "free itself, but he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it.\n",
      "The Spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate\n",
      "reversed, he saw an alteration in the Phantom's hood and dress.\n",
      "It shrunk, collapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "STAVE V:  THE END OF IT\n",
      "\n",
      "YES! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own,\n",
      "the room was his own. Best and happiest of all, the Time\n",
      "before him was his own, to make amends in!\n",
      "\n",

      "about him.\n",

      "\"EH?\" returned the boy, with all his might of wonder.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"To-day!\" replied the boy. \"Why, CHRISTMAS DAY.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's Christmas Day!\" said Scrooge to himself. \"I\n",
      "haven't missed it. The Spirits have done it all in one night.\n",
      "They can do anything they like. Of course they can. Of\n",
      "course they can. Hallo, my fine fellow!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Do you know the Poulterer's, in the next street but one,\n",
      "at the corner?\" Scrooge inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should hope I did,\" replied the lad.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An intelligent boy!\" said Scrooge. \"A remarkable boy!\n",
      "Do you know whether they've sold the prize Turkey that\n",
      "was hanging up there?--Not the little prize Turkey: the\n",
      "big one?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What, the one as big as me?\" returned the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a delightful boy!\" said Scrooge. \"It's a pleasure\n",
      "to talk to him. Yes, my buck!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's hanging there now,\" replied the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it?\" said Scrooge. \"Go and buy it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Walk-ER!\" exclaimed the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no,\" said Scrooge, \"I am in earnest. Go and buy\n",
      "it, and tell 'em to bring it here, that I may give them the\n",
      "direction where to take it. Come back with the man, and\n",
      "I'll give you a shilling. Come back with him in less than\n",
      "five minutes and I'll give you half-a-crown!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy was off like a shot. He must have had a steady\n",
      "hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's!\" whispered Scrooge,\n",
      "rubbing his hands, and splitting with a laugh. \"He sha'n't\n",
      "know who sends it. It's twice the size of Tiny Tim. Joe\n",
      "Miller never made such a joke as sending it to Bob's\n",
      "will be!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady\n",
      "one, but write it he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to\n",
      "open the street door, ready for the coming of the poulterer's\n",
      "man. As he stood there, waiting his arrival, the knocker\n",
      "caught his eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall love it, as long as I live!\" cried Scrooge, patting\n",
      "it with his hand. \"I scarcely ever looked at it before.\n",
      "What an honest expression it has in its face! It's a\n",
      "wonderful knocker!--Here's the Turkey! Hallo! Whoop!\n",
      "How are you! Merry Christmas!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a Turkey! He never could have stood upon his\n",
      "legs, that bird. He would have snapped 'em short off in a\n",
      "minute, like sticks of sealing-wax.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it's impossible to carry that to Camden Town,\"\n",
      "said Scrooge. \"You must have a cab.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with\n",
      "which he paid for the Turkey, and the chuckle with which\n",
      "he paid for the cab, and the chuckle with which he recompensed\n",
      "the boy, were only to be exceeded by the chuckle\n",
      "with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and\n",
      "chuckled till he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to\n",
      "shake very much; and shaving requires attention, even when\n",
      "you don't dance while you are at it. But if he had cut the\n",
      "end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of\n",
      "sticking-plaister over it, and been quite satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "He dressed himself \"all in his best,\" and at last got out\n",
      "into the streets. The people were by this time pouring forth,\n",
      "as he had seen them with the Ghost of Christmas Present;\n",
      "and walking with his hands behind him, Scrooge regarded\n",
      "every one with a delighted smile. He looked so irresistibly\n",
      "pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured fellows\n",
      "said, \"Good morning, sir! A merry Christmas to you!\"\n",
      "And Scrooge said often afterwards, that of all the blithe\n",
      "sounds he had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not gone far, when coming on towards him he\n",
      "beheld the portly gentleman, who had walked into his\n",
      "counting-house the day before, and said, \"Scrooge and Marley's, I\n",
      "believe?\"  It sent a pang across his heart to think how this\n",
      "old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but he\n",
      "knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear sir,\" said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and\n",
      "taking the old gentleman by both his hands. \"How do you\n",
      "do? I hope you succeeded yesterday. It was very kind of\n",
      "you. A merry Christmas to you, sir!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Scrooge?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Scrooge. \"That is my name, and I fear it\n",
      "may not be pleasant to you. Allow me to ask your pardon.\n",
      "And will you have the goodness\"--here Scrooge whispered in\n",
      "his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord bless me!\" cried the gentleman, as if his breath\n",
      "were taken away. \"My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you please,\" said Scrooge. \"Not a farthing less. A\n",
      "great many back-payments are included in it, I assure you.\n",
      "Will you do me that favour?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear sir,\" said the other, shaking hands with him.\n",
      "\"I don't know what to say to such munifi--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't say anything, please,\" retorted Scrooge. \"Come\n",
      "and see me. Will you come and see me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will!\" cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he\n",
      "meant to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank'ee,\" said Scrooge. \"I am much obliged to you.\n",
      "I thank you fifty times. Bless you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He went to church, and walked about the streets, and\n",
      "watched the people hurrying to and fro, and patted children\n",
      "on the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into\n",
      "the kitchens of houses, and up to the windows, and found\n",
      "that everything could yield him pleasure. He had never\n",
      "dreamed that any walk--that anything--could give him so\n",
      "much happiness. In the afternoon he turned his steps\n",
      "towards his nephew's house.\n",
      "\n",
      "He passed the door a dozen times, before he had the\n",
      "courage to go up and knock. But he made a dash, and\n",
      "did it:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is your master at home, my dear?\" said Scrooge to the\n",
      "girl. Nice girl! Very.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is he, my love?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I'll\n",
      "show you up-stairs, if you please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank'ee. He knows me,\" said Scrooge, with his hand\n",
      "already on the dining-room lock. \"I'll go in here, my dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the door.\n",
      "They were looking at the table (which was spread out in\n",
      "great array); for these young housekeepers are always nervous\n",
      "on such points, and like to see that everything is right.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fred!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started!\n",
      "Scrooge had forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting\n",
      "in the corner with the footstool, or he wouldn't have done\n",
      "it, on any account.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why bless my soul!\" cried Fred, \"who's that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner.\n",
      "Will you let me in, Fred?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Let him in! It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off.\n",
      "He was at home in five minutes. Nothing could be heartier.\n",
      "His niece looked just the same. So did Topper when he\n",
      "came. So did the plump sister when she came. So did\n",
      "every one when they came. Wonderful party, wonderful\n",
      "games, wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!\n",
      "\n",
      "But he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was\n",
      "early there. If he could only be there first, and catch Bob\n",
      "Cratchit coming late! That was the thing he had set his\n",
      "heart upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No\n",
      "Bob. A quarter past. No Bob. He was full eighteen\n",
      "minutes and a half behind his time. Scrooge sat with his\n",
      "door wide open, that he might see him come into the Tank.\n",
      "\n",
      "His hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter\n",
      "too. He was on his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his\n",
      "pen, as if he were trying to overtake nine o'clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hallo!\" growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice, as\n",
      "near as he could feign it. \"What do you mean by coming\n",
      "here at this time of day?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very sorry, sir,\" said Bob. \"I am behind my time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are?\" repeated Scrooge. \"Yes. I think you are.\n",
      "Step this way, sir, if you please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's only once a year, sir,\" pleaded Bob, appearing from\n",
      "the Tank. \"It shall not be repeated. I was making rather\n",
      "merry yesterday, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,\" said Scrooge, \"I\n",
      "am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer. And\n",
      "therefore,\" he continued, leaping from his stool, and giving\n",
      "Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into\n",
      "the Tank again; \"and therefore I am about to raise your\n",
      "salary!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He\n",
      "had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it,\n",
      "holding him, and calling to the people in the court for help\n",
      "and a strait-waistcoat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A merry Christmas, Bob!\" said Scrooge, with an earnestness\n",
      "that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the\n",
      "back. \"A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I\n",
      "have given you, for many a year! I'll raise your salary, and\n",
      "endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss\n",
      "your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of\n",
      "smoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires, and buy another\n",
      "coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and\n",
      "infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was\n",
      "a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a\n",
      "master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or\n",
      "any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old\n",
      "world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him,\n",
      "but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was\n",
      "wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this\n",
      "globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill\n",
      "of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these\n",
      "would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they\n",
      "should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in\n",
      "less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was\n",
      "quite enough for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon\n",
      "the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was\n",
      "always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas\n",
      "well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that\n",
      "be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim\n",

      "Spanish literature, in its broadest sense, might include writings\n",
      "in every tongue existing within the Spanish dominions; it might, at\n",
      "all events, include the four chief languages of Spain. Asturian and\n",
      "Galician both possess literatures which in their recent developments\n",
      "are artificial. Basque, the spoiled child of philologers, has not\n",
      "added greatly to the sum of the world's delight; and even if it had,\n",
      "I should be incapable of undertaking a task which would belong of\n",
      "right to experts like Mr. Wentworth Webster, M. Jules Vinson, and\n",
      "Professor Schuchardt. Catalan is so singularly rich and varied that\n",
      "it might well deserve separate treatment: its inclusion here would\n",
      "be as unjustifiable as the inclusion of ProvenÃ§al in a work dealing\n",
      "with French literature. For the purposes of this book, minor varieties\n",
      "are neglected, and Spanish literature is taken as referring solely to\n",
      "Castilianâthe speech of Juan Ruiz, Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Tirso de\n",

      "depuis quatre, depuis six, qu'a-t elle fait pour l'Europe?\" I have\n",
      "attempted an answer in this volume. The introductory chapter has\n",
      "been written to remind readers that the great figures of the Silver\n",

      "Romans. It further aims at tracing the stream of literature from its\n",
      "Roman fount to the channels of the Gothic period; at defining the\n",
      "limits of Arabic and Hebrew influence on Spanish letters; at refuting\n",
      "the theory which assumes the existence of immemorial _romances_, and\n",
      "at explaining the interaction between Spanish on the one side and\n",

      "of all lands to magnify their literary history; yet it may be claimed\n",
      "for Spain, as for England, that she has used her models without\n",
      "compromising her originality, absorbing here, annexing there, and\n",
      "finally dominating her first masters. But Spain's victorious course,\n",
      "splendid as it was in letters, arts, and arms, was comparatively brief.\n",
      "The heroic age of her literature extends over some hundred and fifty\n",
      "years, from the accession of Carlos Quinto to the death of Felipe IV.\n",
      "This period has been treated, as it deserves, at greater length than\n",

      "The most ancient monuments of Castilian literature can be referred\n",
      "to no time later than the twelfth century, and they have been dated\n",
      "earlier with some plausibility. As with men of Spanish stock, so\n",
      "with their letters: the national idiosyncrasy is emphaticâalmost\n",
      "violent. French literature is certainly more exquisite, more brilliant;\n",
      "English is loftier and more varied; but in the capital qualities of\n",
      "originality, force, truth, and humour, the Castilian finds no superior.\n",
      "The Basques, who have survived innumerable onsets (among them, the\n",
      "ridicule of Rabelais and the irony of Cervantes), are held by some\n",
      "to be representatives of the Stone-age folk who peopled the east,\n",
      "north-east, and south of Spain. This notion is based mainly upon the\n",
      "fact that all true Basque names for cutting instruments are derived\n",
      "from the word _aitz_ (flint). Howbeit, the Basques vaunt no literary\n",
      "history in the true sense. The _Leloaren Cantua_ (_Song of Lelo_) has\n",
      "been accepted as a contemporary hymn written in celebration of a\n",
      "Basque triumph over Augustus. Its date is uncertain, and its refrain\n",
      "of \"_Lelo_\" seems a distorted reminiscence of the Arabic catchword _LÄ\n",
      "ilÄh illÄ 'llÄh_; but the _Leloaren Cantua_ is assuredly no older than\n",
      "the sixteenth century.\n",
      "\n",
      "A second performance in this sort is the _Altobiskarko Cantua_ (_Song\n",
      "of Altobiskar_). Altobiskar is a hill near Roncesvalles, where\n",
      "the Basques are said to have defeated Charlemagne; and the song\n",
      "commemorates the victory. Written in a rhythm without fellow in the\n",
      "Basque metres, it contains names like Roland and Ganelon, which are in\n",
      "themselves proofs of French origin; but, as it has been widely received\n",
      "as genuine, the facts concerning it must be told. First written in\n",
      "French (_circa_ 1833) by FranÃ§ois EugÃ¨ne Garay de Monglave, it was\n",
      "translated into very indifferent Basque by a native of Espelette named\n",
      "Louis Duhalde, then a student in Paris. The too-renowned _Altobiskarko\n",
      "Cantua_ is therefore a simple hoax: one might as well attribute\n",
      "_Rule Britannia_ to Boadicea. The conquerors of Roncesvalles wrote\n",
      "no triumphing song: three centuries later the losers immortalised\n",
      "their own overthrow in the _Chanson de Roland_, where the disaster is\n",
      "credited to the Arabs, and the Basques are merely mentioned by the way.\n",
      "Early in the twelfth century there was written a Latin _Chronicle_\n",
      "ascribed to Archbishop Turpin, an historical personage who ruled the\n",
      "see of Rheims some two hundred years before his false _Chronicle_ was\n",
      "written. The opening chapters of this fictitious history are probably\n",
      "due to an anonymous Spanish monk cloistered at Santiago de Compostela;\n",
      "and it is barely possible that this late source was utilised by such\n",
      "modern Basques as JosÃ© MarÃ­a Goizcueta, who retouched and \"restored\"\n",
      "the _Altobiskarko Cantua_ in ignorant good faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "However that may prove, no existing Basque song is much more than three\n",
      "hundred years old. One single Basque of genius, the Chancellor Pero\n",
      "LÃ³pez de Ayala, shines a portent in the literature of the fourteenth\n",
      "century; and even so, he writes in Castilian. He stands alone, isolated\n",
      "from his race. The oldest Basque book, well named as _LinguÃ¦ Vasconum\n",
      "PrimitiÃ¦_, is a collection of exceedingly minor verse by Bernard\n",
      "Dechepare, curÃ© of Saint-Michel, near Saint-Jean Pied de Port; and\n",
      "its date is modern (1545). Pedro de Axular is the first Basque who\n",
      "shows any originality in his native tongue; and, characteristically\n",
      "enough, he deals with religious matters. Though he lived at Sare, in\n",
      "the Basses PyrÃ©nÃ©es, he was a Spaniard from Navarre; and he flourished\n",
      "in the seventeenth century (1643). It is true that a small knot of\n",
      "second-class Basqueâthe epic poet Ercilla y ZÃºÃ±iga, and the fabulist\n",
      "Iriarteâfigure in Castilian literature; but the Basque glories are\n",
      "to be sought in other fieldâin such heroic personages as Ignacio\n",
      "Loyola, and his mightier disciple Francisco Xavier. Setting aside\n",
      "devotional and didactic works, mostly translated from other tongues,\n",
      "Basque literature is chiefly oral, and has but a formal connection\n",
      "with the history of Spanish letters. Within narrow geographical\n",
      "limits the Basque language still thrives, and on each slope of the\n",
      "Pyrenees holds its own against forces apparently irresistible. But\n",
      "its vitality exceeds its reproductive force: it survives but does not\n",
      "multiply. Whatever the former influence of Basque on Castilianâan\n",
      "influence never greatâit has now ceased; while Castilian daily tends\n",
      "to supplant (or, at least, to supplement) Basque. Spain's later\n",
      "invadersâIberians, Kelts, PhÅnicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Alani,\n",
      "Suevi, Goths, and Arabsâhave left but paltry traces on the prevailing\n",
      "form of Spanish speech, which derives from Latin by a descent more\n",
      "obvious, though not a whit more direct, than the descent of French.\n",
      "So frail is the partition which divides the Latin mother from her\n",
      "noblest daughter, that late in the sixteenth century Fernando PÃ©rez\n",
      "de Oliva wrote a treatise that was at once Latin and Spanish: a thing\n",
      "intelligible in either tongue and futile in both, though held for\n",
      "praiseworthy in an age when the best poets chose to string lines into a\n",
      "polyglot rosary, without any distinction save that of antic dexterity.\n",
      "\n",
      "For our purpose, the dawn of literature in Spain begins with the\n",
      "Roman conquest. In colonies like Pax Augusta (Badajoz), CÃ¦sar Augusta\n",
      "(Zaragoza), and Emerita Augusta (MÃ©rida), the Roman influence was\n",
      "strengthened by the intermarriage of Roman soldiers with Spanish women.\n",
      "All over Spain there arose the _odiosa cantio_, as St. Augustine calls\n",
      "it, of Spanish children learning Latin; and every school formed a fresh\n",
      "centre of Latin authority. With their laws, the conquerors imposed\n",
      "their speech upon the broken tribes; and these, in turn, invaded\n",
      "the capital of Latin politics and letters. The breath of Spanish\n",
      "genius informs the Latinity of the Silver Age. Augustus himself had\n",
      "named his Spanish freedman, Gaius Julius Hyginus, the Chief Keeper\n",
      "of the Palatine Library. Spanish literary aptitude, showing stronger\n",
      "in the prodigious learning of the Elder Seneca, matures in the\n",
      "altisonant rhetoric and violent colouring of the Younger, in Lucan's\n",
      "declamatory eloquence and metallic music, in Martial's unblushing\n",
      "humour and brutal cynicism, in Quintilian's luminous judgment and wise\n",
      "sententiousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these display in germ the characteristic points of strength and\n",
      "weakness which were to be developed in the evolution of Spanish\n",
      "literature; and their influence on letters was matched by their\n",
      "countrymen's authority on affairs. The Spaniard Balbus was the first\n",
      "barbarian to reach the Consulship, and to receive the honour of a\n",
      "public triumph; the Spaniard Trajan was the first barbarian named\n",
      "Emperor, the first Emperor to make the Tigris the eastern boundary of\n",
      "his dominion, and the only Emperor whose ashes were allowed to rest\n",
      "within the Roman city-walls. And the victory of the vanquished was\n",
      "complete when the Spaniard Hadrian, the author of the famous versesâ\n",

      "to the accession of Commodus\"; and the Spaniard, accounting Marcus\n",
      "Aurelius as a son of CÃ³rdoba, vaunts with reasonable pride, that of\n",

      "beneath the sceptre of the Spanish CÃ¦sars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Withal, individual success apart, the Spanish utterance of Latin teased\n",
      "the finer ear. Cicero ridiculed the accentâ_aliquid pingue_âof\n",
      "even the more lettered Spaniards who reached Rome; Martial, retired\n",
      "to his native Bilbilis, shuddered lest he might let fall a local\n",
      "idiom; and Quintilian, a sterner purist than a very Roman, frowned at\n",
      "the intrusion of his native provincialisms upon the everyday talk of\n",
      "the capital. In Rome incorrections of speech were found where least\n",
      "expected. That Catullus should jeer at Arriusâthe forerunner of a\n",
      "London typeâin the matter of aspirates is natural enough; but even\n",
      "Augustus distressed the nice grammarian. _A fortiori_, Hadrian was\n",
      "taunted with his Spanish solecisms. Innovation won the day. The century\n",
      "between Livy and Tacitus shows differences of style inexplicable by the\n",
      "easy theory of varieties of temperament; and the two centuries dividing\n",
      "Tacitus from St. Augustine are marked by changes still more striking.\n",
      "This is but another illustration of the old maxim, that as the speed of\n",
      "falling bodies increases with distance, so literary decadences increase\n",
      "with time.\n",

      "As in Italy and Africa, so in Spain. The statelier _sermo urbanus_\n",
      "yielded to the _sermo plebeius_. Spanish soldiers had discovered\n",
      "\"the fatal secret of empire, that emperors could be made elsewhere\n",
      "than at Rome\"; no less fatal was the discovery that Latin might be\n",
      "spoken without regard for Roman models. As the power of classic forms\n",
      "waned, that of ecclesiastical examples grew. Church Latin of the\n",
      "fourth century shines at its best in the verse of the Christian poet,\n",
      "the Spaniard Prudentius: with him the classical rhythms persistâas\n",
      "survivals. He clutches at, rather than grasps, the Roman verse\n",
      "tradition, and, though he has no rhyming stanzas, he verges on rhyme\n",
      "in such performances as his _Hymnus ad Galli Cantum_. Throughout the\n",
      "noblest period of Roman poetry, soldiers, sailors, and illiterates\n",
      "had, in the _versus saturnius_, preserved a native rhythmical system\n",
      "not quantitative but accentual; and this vulgar metrical method was to\n",
      "outlive its fashionable rival. It is doubtful whether the quantitative\n",
      "prosody, brought from Greece by literary dandies, ever flourished\n",
      "without the circle of professional men of letters. It is indisputable\n",
      "that the imported metrical rules, depending on the power of vowels and\n",
      "the position of consonants, were gradually superseded by looser laws of\n",
      "syllabic quantity wherein accent and tonic stress were the main factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the empire fell, Spain became the easy prey of northern\n",
      "barbarians, who held the country by the sword, and intermarried but\n",
      "little with its people. To the Goths Spain owes nothing but eclipse\n",
      "and ruin. No books, no inscriptions of Gothic origin survive; the\n",
      "Gongoristic letters ascribed to King Sisebut are not his work, and\n",
      "it is doubtful if the Goths bequeathed more than a few words to the\n",
      "Spanish vocabulary. The defeat of Roderic by Tarik and MÅ«sa laid Spain\n",
      "open to the Arab rush. National sentiment was unborn. Witiza and\n",
      "Roderic were regarded by Spaniards as men in Italy and Africa regarded\n",
      "Totila and Galimar. The clergy were alienated from their Gothic rulers.\n",
      "Gothic favourites were appointed to non-existent dioceses carrying huge\n",
      "revenues; a single Goth held two sees simultaneously; and, by way of\n",
      "balance, Toledo was misgoverned by two rival Gothic bishops. Harassed\n",
      "by a severe penal code, the Jew hailed the invading Arabs as a kindred,\n",
      "oriental, circumcised race; and, with the heathen slaves, they went\n",
      "over to the conquerors. So obscure is the history of the ensuing years\n",
      "that it has been said that the one thing certain is Roderic's name.\n",
      "Not less certain is it that, within a brief space, almost the entire\n",

      "forgotten; but he deserves remembrance because of his achievement\n",
      "as an epigraphist, and because he moved his friend, St. Jerome, to\n",
      "translate the Bible. To him succeeds Hosius of CÃ³rdoba, the mentor of\n",
      "Constantine, the champion of Athanasian orthodoxy, and the presiding\n",

      "man is above beast. Priscillian and his fellow-sufferer Latrocinius,\n",
      "the first martyrs slain by Christianity set in office, were both clerks\n",
      "of singular accomplishment. As disciple of St. Augustine, and comrade\n",
      "of St. Jerome, Orosius would be remembered, even were he not the\n",
      "earliest historian of the world. Like Prudentius, Orosius blends the\n",
      "passion of universal empire with the fervour of local sentiment. Good,\n",

      "world-mother, Rome; and his heart softens towards the blind barbarians,\n",
      "their faces turned towards the light. Cold, austere, and even a trifle\n",
      "cynical as he is, Orosius' pulses throb at memory of CÃ¦sar; and he\n",
      "glows on thinking that, a citizen of no mean city, he ranges the world\n",

      "the use of MuzÃ¡rabes; and still stronger evidence of the low estate of\n",

      "sometimes composed in Arabic rather than in their native Hebrew; and it\n",
      "is almost certain that the lays of the Arab _rÄwis_ radically modified\n",
      "the structure of Hebrew verse. Apart from the evidence of Paulus\n",
      "Alvarus Cordubiensis, St. Eulogius deposes that certain Christiansâhe\n",
      "mentions Isaac the Martyr by nameâspoke Arabic to perfection. Nor can\n",
      "it be pleaded that this zeal was invariably due to official pressure:\n",
      "on the contrary, a caliph went the length of forbidding Spanish Jews\n",
      "and Christians to learn Arabic. Neither did the fashion die soon:\n",
      "long after the Arab predominance was shaken, Arabic was the modish\n",

      "superscription, was invented to combat the Almoravide _dÄ«nÄr_, which\n",
      "rivalled the popularity of the Constantinople besant; and as late as\n",

      "Yet, even so, the rude Latin of the unconquered north remained\n",
      "well-nigh intact. Save in isolated centres, it was spoken by countless\n",

      "of Tingitana. Vast deduction must be made from the jeremiads of Paulus\n",
      "Alvarus Cordubiensis. As he bewails the time wasted on Hebrew and\n",

      "the customs of the Spaniards; and the Castilian-speaking Arabâthe\n",
      "_moro latinado_âmultiplied prodigiously. No small proportion of Arab\n",
      "writersâIbn Hazm, for exampleâwas made up of sons or grandsons\n",
      "of Spaniards, not unacquainted with their fathers' speech. When\n",

      "Henricus Seynensis, who lives eternal by mistaking the _Talmud_â\"Rabbi\n",
      "Talmud\"âfor a man. But no Arab work endures. And as with Arab\n",
      "philosophy in Spain, so with the Arabic language: its soul was required\n",
      "of it. Hebrew, indeed, was not forgotten; and for Arabic, a revival\n",
      "might be expected during the Crusades. Yet in all Europe, outside\n",
      "Spain, but three isolated Arabists of that time are knownâWilliam of\n",
      "Tyre, Philip of Tripoli, and Adelard of Bath; and in Spain itself,\n",
      "when Boabdil surrendered in 1492, the tide had run so low that not a\n",
      "thousand Arabs in Granada could speak their native tongue. Nearly two\n",
      "centuries before (in 1311-12) a council under Pope Clement V. advised\n",
      "the establishment of Arabic chairs in the universities of Salamanca,\n",
      "Bologna, Paris, and Oxford. Save at Bologna, the counsel was ignored;\n",

      "Save a group of technical words, the sole literary legacy bequeathed\n",
      "to Spain by the Arabs was their alphabet. This they used in writing\n",
      "Castilian, calling their transcription _aljamÃ­a_ (_ajami_ = foreign),\n",
      "which was the original name of the broken Latin spoken by the\n",
      "MuzÃ¡rabes. First introduced in legal documents, the practice was\n",
      "prudently continued during the reconquest, and, besides its secrecy,\n",
      "was further recommended by the fact that a special sanctity attaches\n",
      "to Arabic characters. But the peculiarity of _aljamÃ­a_ is that it\n",
      "begot a literature of its own, though, naturally enough, a literature\n",
      "modelled on the Spanish. Its best production is the _Poema de Yusuf_;\n",
      "and it may be noted that this, like its much later fellow, _La Alabanza\n",
      "de Mahoma_ (The Praise of Muhammad), is in the metre of the old Spanish\n",
      "\"clerkly poems\" (_poesÃ­as de clerecÃ­a_). So also the Aragonese Morisco,\n",
      "Muhammad RabadÃ¡n, writes his cyclic poem in Spanish octosyllabics; and\n",
      "in his successors there are hendecasyllabics manifestly imitated from\n",
      "a characteristic Galician measure (_de gaita gallega_). The subjects\n",
      "of the _textos aljamiados_ are frankly conveyed from Western sources:\n",
      "the _Compilation of Alexander_, an orientalised version of the French;\n",
      "the _History of the Loves of Paris and Viana_, a translation from\n",
      "the ProvenÃ§al; and the _Maid of Arcayona_, based on the Spanish poem\n",
      "_Apolonio_. In the _Cancionero de Baena_ appears Mahomat-el-Xartosse,\n",
      "without his turban, as a full-fledged Spanish poet; and the old\n",
      "tradition of servility is continued by an anonymous refugee in Tunis,\n",
      "who shows himself an authority on the plays and the lyric verse of Lope\n",
      "de Vega.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is therefore erroneous to suppose that the northern Spaniards on\n",
      "their southward march fell in with numerous kinsmen, of wider culture\n",
      "and of a higher civilisation, whose everyday speech was unintelligible\n",
      "to them, and who prayed to Christ in the tongue of Muhammad. Such\n",
      "cases may have occurred, but as the rarest exceptions. Not less\n",
      "unfounded is the theory that Castilian is a fusion of southern\n",
      "academic Arabic with barbarous northern Latin. In southern Spain Latin\n",
      "persisted, as Greek, Syriac, and Coptic persisted in other provinces\n",
      "of the Caliphate; and in the school founded at CÃ³rdoba by the Abbot\n",
      "Spera-in-Deo, Livy, Cicero, Virgil, Quintilian, and Demosthenes were\n",
      "read as assiduously as Sallust, Horace, and Terence were studied in\n",
      "the northern provinces. Granting that Latin was for a while so much\n",
      "neglected that it was necessary to translate the Bible into Arabic, it\n",
      "is also true that Arabic grew so forgotten that Peter the Venerable\n",
      "was forced to translate the Ku'rÄn for the benefit of clerks. Lastly,\n",
      "it must be borne in mind that the variety of Romance which finally\n",
      "prevailed in Spain was not the speech of the northern highlanders,\n",
      "but that of the MuzÃ¡rabes of the south and the centre. Long before\n",
      "\"the sword of Pelagius had been transformed into the sceptre of the\n",
      "Catholic kings,\" the linguistic triumph of the south was achieved. The\n",
      "hazard of war might have yielded another issue; and to adopt another\n",
      "celebrated phrase of Gibbon's, but for the Cid and his successors, the\n",

      "the revelation of Muhammad. As it chanced, Arabic was rebuffed, and\n",
      "the Latin speech (or _Romance_) survived in its principal varieties of\n",
      "Castilian, Galician, Catalan, and _bable_ (Asturian).\n",
      "\n",
      "Gallic Latin had already bifurcated into the _langue d'oui_ and the\n",
      "_langue d'oc_, though these names were not applied to the varieties\n",
      "till near the close of the twelfth century. Two hundred years before\n",

      "and, in the corner south of the Adour, reimposed a tongue which Latin\n",

      "Moreover, from the outset there is a counter-current in Castile. The\n",

      "from obvious foreign touches in the early recensions of the story of\n",
      "Bernaldo de Carpio (who figures as Charlemagne's nephew), the tone of\n",
      "the ballads is hostile to the French, and, as is natural, the enmity\n",
      "grows more pronounced with time. That national hero, the Cid, is\n",
      "especially anti-French. He casts the King of France in gaol; he throws\n",
      "away the French King's chair with insult in St. Peter's. Still more\n",

      "a jest. Thus, the balladist emphasises the fact that the faithless\n",
      "wife of Garci-FernÃ¡ndez is French; and, again, when Sancho GarcÃ­a's\n",
      "mother, likewise French, appears in a _romance_, the singer gives her\n",
      "a blackamoorâan Arabâas a lover. This is primitive man's little\n",
      "way, the world over: he pays off old scores by deriding the virtue of\n",
      "his enemy's wife, mother, daughter, sister; and in primitive Spain\n",

      "tolerable by the camp-fire, but tedious in print.\n",
      "\n",
      "In considering early Spanish verse it behoves us to denote facts\n",
      "and to be chary in drawing inferences. Thus, while we admit that\n",
      "the _Poema del Cid_ and the _Chanson de Roland_ belong to the same\n",
      "_genre_, we can go no further. It is not to be assumed that similarity\n",
      "of incident necessarily implies direct imitation. The introduction of\n",
      "the fighting bishop in the Cid poem is a case in point. His presence\n",
      "in the field may beâalmost certainly isâan historic event, common\n",
      "enough in days when a militant bishop loved to head a charge; and the\n",
      "chronicler may well have seen the exploits which he records. It by\n",
      "no means follows, and it is extravagant to suppose, that the Spanish\n",
      "_juglar_ merely filches from the _Chanson de Roland_. That he had\n",
      "heard the _Chanson_ is not only probable, but likely; it is not, to\n",
      "say the least, a necessary consequence that he annexed an episode as\n",
      "familiar in Spain as elsewhere. Nothing, if you probe deep enough, is\n",
      "new, and originality is a vain dream. But some margin must be left for\n",
      "personal experience and the hazard of circumstance; and if we take\n",
      "account of the chances of coincidence, the debt of Castilian to French\n",
      "literature will appear in its due perspective. Nor must it be forgotten\n",
      "that from a very early date there are traces of the reflex action of\n",
      "Castilian upon French literature. They are not, indeed, many; but they\n",

      "Led by the heavenly star, the three Magi first appear separately, then\n",
      "together; they celebrate the birth of Christ, whom they seek to adore,\n",

      "they confide to him their mission; the King conjures his \"abbots\"\n",

      "Nevertheless, in its surviving shape it is the result of innumerable\n",
      "retouches which amount to botching. Its authorship is more than\n",
      "doubtful, for the Per Abbat who obtrudes in the closing lines is,\n",
      "like the Turoldus of _Roland_, the mere transcriber of an unfaithful\n",
      "copy. Our gratitude to Per Abbat is dashed with regret for his\n",
      "slapdash methods. The assonants are roughly handled, whole phrases are\n",
      "unintelligently repeated, are transferred from one line to another, or\n",
      "are thrust out from the text, and in some cases two lines are crushed\n",
      "into one. The prevailing metre is the Alexandrine or fourteen-syllabled\n",

      "orthodoxy; the cunning intriguer who rifled Jews and mocked at treaties\n",
      "is transfigured as the chivalrous paladin; the unsentimental trooper\n",
      "who never loved is delivered unto us as the typical _jeune premier_.\n",

      "title (_Sidi_ = lord). Yet two points must be kept in mind: the facts\n",
      "which discredit him are reported by hostile Arab historians; and,\n",
      "again, the Cid is entitled to be judged by the standard of his country\n",
      "and his time. So judged, we may accept the verdict of his enemies, who\n",
      "cursed him as \"a miracle of the miracles of God and the conqueror of\n",
      "banners.\" Ruy Diaz de Bivarâto give him his true nameâwas something\n",
      "more than a freebooter whose deeds struck the popular fancy: he stood\n",
      "for unity, for the supremacy of Castile over LeÃ³n, and his example\n",
      "proved that, against almost any odds, the Spaniards could hold their\n",
      "own against the Moors. In the long night between the disaster of\n",
      "Alarcos and the crowning triumph of Navas de Tolosa, the Cid's figure\n",
      "grew glorious as that of the man who had never despaired of his\n",

      "not forgotten. From his death at Valencia in 1099, his memory became a\n",

      "\n",
      "In the _Poema_ the treatment is obviously modelled upon the _Chanson de\n",

      "Cid Campeador. Bishop Turpin opens the battle in _Roland_, and Bishop\n",
      "Jerome heads the charge for Spain. Roland and Ruy Diaz are absolved\n",
      "and exhorted to the same effect, and the resemblance of the epithet\n",
      "_curunez_ applied to the French bishop is too close to the _coronado_\n",
      "of the Spaniard to be accidental. But allowing for the fact that the\n",
      "Spanish _juglar_ borrows his framework, his performance is great by\n",
      "virtue of its simplicity, its strength, its spirit and fire. Whether\n",
      "he deals with the hungry loyalty of the Cid in exile, or his reception\n",

      "the Count of Barcelona or the surrender of Valencia; whether he sings\n",
      "the nuptials of Elvira and Sol with the Infantes de CarriÃ³n, or the\n",
      "avenging Cid who seeks reparation from his craven son-in-law, the touch\n",

      "There is an unity of conception and of language which forbids our\n",

      "of the Infantes de CarriÃ³n, and the proud announcement that the kings\n",
      "of Spain are sprung from the Cid's loins. In both the singer rises to\n",
      "the level of his subject, but his chiefest gust is in the recital of\n",
      "some brilliant deed of arms. Judge him when, in a famous passage well\n",
      "rendered by Ormsby, he sings the charge of the Cid at Alcocer:â\n",

      "  \"_With bucklers braced before their breasts, with lances pointing low,\n",

      "  And he that in a good hour was born, his clarion voice rings out,\n",

      "  And, when they wheel, three hundred more, as charging back they go.\n",
      "  It was a sight to see the lances rise and fall that day;\n",
      "  The shivered shields and riven mail, to see how thick they lay;\n",

      "Indubitably this (and it were easy to match it elsewhere in the\n",
      "_Poema_) is the work of an original genius who redeems his superficial\n",
      "borrowings of incident from _Roland_ by a treatment all his own. That\n",
      "he knew the French models is evident from his skilful conveyance of the\n",
      "bear episode in _Ider_ to his own pages, where the Cid encounters the\n",
      "beast as a lion. But the language shows no hint of French influence,\n",
      "and both thought and expression are profoundly national. The poet's\n",
      "name is irrecoverable, but the internal evidence points strongly to\n",
      "the conclusion that he came from the neighbourhood of Medina Celi.\n",
      "The surmise that he was an Asturian rests solely upon the absence of\n",
      "the diphthong _ue_ from his lines, an inference on the face of it\n",
      "unwarrantable. Against this is the topographical minuteness with which\n",
      "the poet reports the sallies of the Cid in the districts of CastejÃ³n\n",
      "and Alcocer; his marked ignorance of the country round Zaragoza and\n",
      "Valencia, his detailed description of the central episodeâthe outrage\n",
      "upon the Cid's daughters in the wood of Corpes, near Berlanga; and\n",
      "the important fact that the four chief itineraries in the _Poema_\n",
      "are charged with minutiÃ¦ from Molina to San Esteban de Gormaz, while\n",
      "they grow vague and more confused as they extend towards Burgos and\n",
      "Valencia. The most probable conjecture, then, is that the unknown maker\n",
      "of this primitive masterpiece came from the Valle de Arbujuelo; and\n",
      "it is worth adding that this opinion is supported by the authority\n",
      "of Sr. MenÃ©ndez Pidal. Perhaps the greatest testimony to the early\n",
      "poet's worth is to be found in this: that his conception of his hero\n",
      "has outlived the true historic Cid, and has forced the child of his\n",
      "imagination upon the acceptance of mankind.\n",

      "Even more fantastic is the personality of Ruy Diaz as rendered by\n",

      "of rugged prose. Not till after digressions into other episodes,\n",
      "and irrelevant stories of Miro and Bernardo, Bishops of Palencia,\n",
      "probably fellow-townsmen of the compiler, does the Cid appear. He is\n",
      "no longer, as in the _Poema_, a popular hero, idealised from historic\n",

      "fables accumulated in course of time. At the age of twelve he slays\n",
      "GÃ³mez GÃ³rmaz (an almost impossible style, compounded of a patronymic\n",

      "poem, the end of which is lost, breaks off with the Pope's request\n",
      "for a year's truce, which Fernando, acting as ever upon the Cid's\n",
      "advice, magnanimously extends for twelve years. It is hard to say\n",
      "whether the _Cantar de Rodrigo_ as we have it is the production of\n",
      "a single composer, or whether it is a patchwork by different hands,\n",
      "arranged from earlier poems, and eked out by prose stories and by oral\n",
      "traditions. The versification is that of the simple sixteen-syllabled\n",
      "line, each hemistich of which forms a typical _romance_ line. This\n",
      "in itself is a sign of its later date, and to this must be added\n",
      "the traces of deliberate imitation of the _Poema_, and the writer's\n",
      "familiarity with such modern devices as heraldic emblems. Further,\n",
      "the use of a ProvenÃ§al form like _gensor_, the unmistakable tokens of\n",
      "French influence, the anticipation of the metre of the clerkly poems,\n",
      "the writer's frank admission of earlier songs on the same subject,\n",
      "the metamorphosis of the Cid into a feudal baron, and, above all, the\n",
      "decadent spirit of the entire work: these are tokens which imply a\n",
      "relative modernity. Much of the obscurity of language, which has been\n",
      "mistaken for archaism, is simply due to the defects of the manuscript;\n",
      "and the evidence goes to show that the _Rodrigo_, put together in the\n",
      "last decade of the twelfth century or the first of the thirteenth, was\n",
      "retouched in the fourteenth by Spanish _juglares_ humiliated by the\n",
      "recent French invasions. Even so, much of the primitive _pastiche_\n",
      "remains, and the _Rodrigo_, which is mentioned in the _General\n",
      "Chronicle_, interests us as being the fountain-head of those _romances_\n",
      "on the Cid whose collection we owe to that enthusiastic and most\n",
      "learned investigator, Madame Carolina MichaÃ«lis de Vasconcellos. Far\n",
      "inferior in merit and interest to the _Poema_, the _Rodrigo_ ranks with\n",

      "hampered by his lack of imagination, by the poverty of his conditions,\n",
      "by the absence of models, by the narrow circle of his subjects, and by\n",
      "the pious scruples which hindered him from arabesquing the original\n",

      "amid his long digressions into prosy theological commonplace there\n",
      "are flashes of mystic inspiration unmatched by any other poet of his\n",

      "at its worst, he accomplishes the end which he desires by popularising\n",

      "pastoral, with all the defects of the inexperienced explorer; and,\n",
      "for the most part, he had nothing to guide him but his own uncultured\n",

      "Vic-sur-Aisne (1177-1236). Certain it is that Gautier's source, the\n",

      "since Alfonso, a middle-aged man when Berceo died, knew the Soissons\n",
      "collection, it seems possible that Berceo also handled it. A close\n",
      "examination of his text converts the bare possibility into something\n",
      "approaching certainty. Of Berceo's twenty-five Marian legends, eighteen\n",
      "are given by Gautier de Coinci, whose total reaches fifty-five. This\n",
      "is not by itself final, for both writers might have selected them from\n",
      "a common source. Yet there are convincing proofs of imitation in the\n",
      "coincidences of thought and expression which are apparent in Gautier\n",
      "and Berceo. These are too numerous to be accidental; and still more\n",
      "weight must be given to the fact that in several cases where Gautier\n",
      "invents a detail of his own wit, Berceo reproduces it. Taken in\n",
      "conjunction with his known habit of strict adherence to his text, it\n",
      "follows that Berceo took Gautier for his guide. He did what all the\n",
      "world was doing in borrowing from the French, and in the _Virgin's\n",

      "\n",
      "Still, it would be wrong to think that Berceo contents himself with\n",
      "mere servile reproduction, or that he trespasses in the manner of\n",
      "a vulgar plagiary. Seven of his legends he seeks elsewhere than in\n",
      "Gautier, and he takes it upon himself to condense his predecessor's\n",
      "diffuse narration. Thus, where Gautier needs 1350 lines to tell the\n",
      "legend of St. Ildefonsus, or 2090 to give the miracle of Theophilus,\n",
      "Berceo confines himself to 108 and to 657 lines. Gautier will spare\n",
      "you no detail; he will have you know the why, the when, the how, the\n",
      "paltriest circumstance of his pious story. Beside him Berceo shines by\n",
      "his power of selection, by his finer instinct for the essential, by\n",
      "his relative sobriety of tone, by his realistic eye, by his variety of\n",
      "resource in pure Castilian expression, by his richer melody, and by the\n",
      "fleeter movement of his action. In a word, with all his imperfections,\n",
      "Berceo approves himself the sounder craftsman of the two, and therefore\n",
      "he finds thirty readers where the Prior of Vic-sur-Aisne finds one.\n",
      "Small and few as his opportunities were, he rarely failed to use\n",
      "them to an advantage; as in the invention of the singular rhymed\n",

      "would have made it differently.\" This deliberate invention is due\n",
      "to Pedro IV. (the Ceremonious); and if Pedro foresaw the result,\n",
      "he must have been a scoundrel of genius. Fortunately, nothing can\n",

      "Political disaster never caused his intellectual activity to slacken.\n",
      "Like Bacon, he took all knowledge for his province, and in every\n",
      "department he shone pre-eminent. Astronomy, music, philosophy, canon\n",
      "and civil law, history, poetry, the study of languages: he forced his\n",
      "people upon these untrodden roads. To catalogue the series of his\n",

      "direction of exactitude and clearness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar qualities of precision and ease were developed in encyclopÃ¦dic\n",

      "contemporaries, and posterity has multiplied the wonder by attributing\n",
      "well-nigh every possible anonymous work to the man whose real activity\n",
      "is a marvel. It has been sought to prove him the author of the _Libro\n",
      "de Alexandre_, the writer of Alexander's _Letters_, the compiler of\n",
      "treatises on the chase, the translator of _Kalilah and Dimnah_, and\n",
      "innumerable more pieces. Not one of these can be brought home to him,\n",
      "and some belong to a later time. Ticknor, again, foists on Alfonso two\n",
      "separate works each entitled the _Tesoro_, and the authorship has been\n",
      "accepted upon that authority. It is therefore necessary to state the\n",
      "real case. The one _Tesoro_ is a prose translation of Brunetto Latini's\n",
      "_Li Livres dou TrÃ©sor_ made by Alfonso de Paredes and Pero GÃ³mez,\n",
      "respectively surgeon and secretary at the court of Sancho, Alfonso's\n",
      "son and successor; the other _Tesoro_, with its prose preamble and\n",
      "forty-eight stanzas, is a forgery vamped by some parasite in the train\n",
      "of Alonso Carrillo, Archbishop of Toledo, during the fifteenth century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alonso de Fuentes, writing three hundred years after Alfonso's death,\n",
      "names him as author of a celebrated _romance_â\"_I left behind my\n",
      "native land_\"; the rhythm and accentuation prove the lines to belong\n",
      "to a fifteenth-century maker whose attribution of them to the King is\n",
      "palpably dramatic. Great authorities accept as authentic the _Libro de\n",
      "Querellas_ (Book of Plaints), which is represented by two fine stanzas\n",
      "addressed to Diego Sarmiento, \"brother and friend and vassal leal\" of\n",
      "\"him whose foot was kissed by kings, him from whom queens sought alms\n",
      "and grace.\" One is sorry to lose them, but they must be rejected. No\n",
      "such book is known to any contemporary; the twelve-syllabled octave in\n",
      "which the stanzas are written was not invented till a hundred years\n",
      "later; and these two stanzas are simply fabrications by Pellicer, who\n",
      "first published them in the seventeenth century in his _Memoir on the\n",
      "House of Sarmiento_, with a view to flattering his patron.\n",

      "This to some extent clears the ground: but not altogether. Setting\n",

      "_Siete Partidas_ (Seven Parts). This name does not appear to have been\n",
      "attached to the code till a hundred years after its compilation; but it\n",
      "may be worth observing that the notion is implied in the name of the\n",
      "_Septenario_, and that Alfonso, regarding the number seven as something\n",
      "of mysterious potency, exhausts himself in citing precedentsâthe seven\n",
      "days of the week, seven metals, seven arts, seven years that Jacob\n",
      "served, seven lean years in Egypt, the seven-branched candlestick,\n",
      "seven sacraments, and so on. The trait is characteristic of the time.\n",
      "It would be a grave mistake to suppose that the _Siete Partidas_ in\n",
      "any way resembles a modern book of statutes, couched in the technical\n",
      "jargon of the law. Its primary object was the unification of the\n",
      "various clashing systems of law which Alfonso encountered within his\n",
      "unsettled kingdom; and this he accomplished with such success that all\n",
      "subsequent Spanish legislation derives from the _Siete Partidas_, which\n",
      "are still to some extent in force in the republican states of Florida\n",
      "and Louisiana. But the design soon outgrows mere practical purpose,\n",
      "and expands into dissertations upon general principles and the pettier\n",
      "details of conduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho Panza, as Governor of Barataria, could not have bettered the\n",
      "counsels of the _Siete Partidas_, whose very titles force a smile:\n",

      "no monk should study law or physics,\" \"Why the King should abstain\n",
      "from low talk,\" \"Why the King should eat and drink moderately,\" \"Why\n",

      "a will so that the witnesses shall not know its tenor,\" with other\n",
      "less prudish discussions. The reading of this code is not merely\n",
      "instructive and curious; apart from its dry humouristic savour, the\n",
      "_Siete Partidas_ rises to a noble eloquence when the subject is the\n",
      "common weal, the office of the ruler, his relations to his people, and\n",
      "the interdependence of Church and State. No man, by his single effort,\n",
      "could draw a code of such intricacy and breadth, and it is established\n",
      "that Jacobo Ruiz and FernÃ¡n MartÃ­nez laboured on it; but Alfonso's is\n",
      "the supreme intelligence which appoints and governs, and his is the\n",
      "revising hand which leaves the text in its perfect verbal form.\n",
      "\n",
      "In history, too, Alfonso sought distinction; and he found it. The\n",

      "1268, the _General e grand Estoria_, begun in 1270, owe to him their\n",
      "inspiration. The latter, ranging from the Creation to Apostolic times,\n",
      "glances at such secular events as the Babylonian Empire and the fall\n",
      "of Troy; the former extends from the peopling of Europe by the sons of\n",
      "Japhet to the death of St. Ferdinand. Rodrigo JimÃ©nez de Rada and Lucas\n",
      "de Tuy are the direct authorities, and their testimonies are completed\n",
      "by elaborate references that stretch from Pliny to the _cantares de\n",
      "gesta_. Moreover, the Arab chronicles are avowedly utilised in the\n",
      "account of the Cid's exploits: \"thus says Abenfarax in his Arabic\n",

      "a strange ignorance of Arabs and their history is shown by the\n",
      "compiler's inclusion of such fables as Muhammad's crusade in CÃ³rdoba.\n",
      "The inevitable conclusion is that the _Estorias_, like the _Siete\n",
      "Partidas_, are compilations by several hands; and the idea is supported\n",
      "by the fact that the prologue to the _Estoria de Espanna_ is scarcely\n",
      "more than a translation of JimÃ©nez de Rada's preface.\n",

      "and even though these attributions be (as seems likely) a trifle\n",
      "fantastical, they at least indicate a long-standing disbelief in the\n",
      "unity of authorship. It is proved that Alfonso gathered from CÃ³rdoba,\n",
      "Seville, Toledo, and Paris some fifty experts to translate Ptolemy's\n",
      "_Quadri partitum_ and other astronomic treatises; it is natural that he\n",
      "should organise a similar committee to put together the first history\n",
      "in the Castilian language. Better than most of his contemporaries,\n",
      "he knew the value of combination. As with astronomy so with history:\n",
      "in both cases he conceived the scheme, in both cases he presided at\n",
      "the redaction and stamped the crude stuff with his distinctive seal.\n",
      "Judged by a modern standard, both _Estorias_ lend themselves to a\n",
      "cheap ridicule; compared with their predecessors, they imply a finer\n",
      "appreciation of the value of testimony, and this notable evolution of\n",
      "the critical sense is matched by a manner that rises to the theme. Side\n",

      "timor Domini._\" St. John, Job, Cato, St. Gregory, the Decretalsâhe\n",
      "calls them all into court to witness his respectable intention, and at\n",

      "by the rules of the _mester de clerecÃ­a_; but he handles it with a\n",
      "freedom unknown before, imparts to it a new flexibility, a variety, a\n",
      "speed, a music beyond all precedent, and transfuses it with a humour\n",
      "which anticipates Cervantes. Nay, he does more. In his prose preface he\n",
      "asserts that he chiefly sought to give examples of prosody, of rhyme\n",
      "and composition:â\"_Dar algunas lecciones, Ã© muestra de versificar,\n",

      "Petrus Alphonsus; for to his mind the improved treatment was of greater\n",
      "worth than the mere bald story. He was familiar with the _Kalilah and\n",

      "apologues of Lull and Juan Manuel. Vast as his reading was, it had\n",

      "with the seamy side of life, his interest in things common and rare,\n",
      "his observation of manners, and his lyrical endowment. The name of \"the\n",
      "Spanish Petronius\" has been given to him; yet, despite a superficial\n",
      "resemblance between the two, it is a misnomer. Far nearer the truth,\n",
      "though the Spaniard lacks the dignity of the Englishman, is Ticknor's\n",
      "parallel with Chaucer. Like Chaucer, Ruiz had an almost incomparable\n",
      "gust for life, an immitigable gaiety of spirit, which penetrates his\n",
      "transcription of the Human Comedy. Like Chaucer, his adventurous\n",
      "curiosity led him to burst the bonds of the prison-house and to\n",
      "confer upon his country new rhythms and metres. His four _cÃ¡nticas de\n",
      "serrana_, suggested by the Galician makers, anticipate by a hundred\n",
      "years the _serranillas_ and the _vaqueiras_ of Santillana, and entitle\n",
      "him to rank as the first great lyric poet of Castile. Ruiz, likewise,\n",
      "had a Legend of Women; but his reading was his own, and Chaucer's\n",
      "adjective cannot be applied to it. His ambition is, not to idealise,\n",
      "but to realise existence, and he interprets its sensuous animalism in\n",
      "the spirit of picaresque enjoyment. Jewesses, Moorish dancers, the\n",
      "procuress _Trota-conventos_, her finicking customers, the loose nuns,\n",

      "\n",
      "The arrangement of Ruiz' verse, disorderly as his life, foreshadows the\n",
      "loose construction of the picaresque novel, of which his own work may\n",
      "be considered the first example. One of his greatest discoveries is the\n",
      "rare value of the autobiographic form. Mingled with parodies of hymns,\n",
      "with burlesques of old _cantares de gesta_, with glorified paraphrases\n",
      "of both Ovids (the true and the false), with versions of oriental\n",
      "fables read in books or gathered from the lips of vagrant Arabs, with\n",
      "peculiar wealth of popular refrains and proverbsâwith these goes the\n",
      "tale of the writer's individual life, rich in self-mockery, gross in\n",
      "thought, abundant in incident, splendid in expression, slyly edifying\n",
      "in the moral conclusion which announces an immediate relapse. Poet,\n",
      "novelist, expert in observation, irony, and travesty, Ruiz had,\n",
      "moreover, the sense of style in such measure as none before him and\n",
      "few after him, and to this innate faculty of selection he joined a\n",
      "great capacity for dramatic creation. Hence the impossibility of\n",
      "exhibiting him in elegant extracts, and hence the permanence of his\n",
      "types. The most familiar figure of _Lazarillo de Tormes_âthe starving\n",
      "gentlemanâis a lineal descendant of Ruiz' Don FurÃ³n, who is scrupulous\n",

      "as Calisto and Melibea to Rojas' tragi-comedy, whence they pass into\n",
      "immortality as Romeo and Juliet. Lastly, Ruiz' repute might be staked\n",

      "itself to Ayala's poem without the author's sanction. It gives a false\n",
      "impression of his theme, which is the decadence of his age. Only within\n",
      "narrow limits does Ayala deal with courts and courtiers; he had a wider\n",
      "outlook, and he scourges society at large. What was a jest to Ruiz was\n",
      "a woe to the Chancellor. Ruiz had a natural sympathy for a loose-living\n",
      "cleric; Ayala lashes this sort with a thong steeped in vitriol. The\n",
      "one looks at life as a farce; the other sees it as a tragedy. Where\n",
      "the first finds matter for merriment, the second burns with the white\n",
      "indignation of the just. The deliberate mordancy of Ayala is impartial\n",
      "insomuch as it is universal. Courtiers, statesmen, bishops, lawyers,\n",
      "merchantsâhe brands them all with corruption, simony, embezzlement,\n",
      "and exposes them as venal sons of Belial. And, like Ruiz, he places\n",
      "himself in the pillory to heighten his effects. He spares not his\n",
      "superstitious belief in omens, dreams, and such-like fooleries; he\n",
      "discovers himself as a grinder of the poor man's face, a libidinous\n",
      "perjurer, a child of perdition.\n",
      "\n",
      "But not all Ayala's poem is given up to cursing. In his 705th stanza\n",

      "written it, \"being sore afflicted by many grievous sorrows,\" and in the\n",
      "remaining 904 stanzas Ayala breathes a serener air. In both existing\n",
      "codicesâthat of Campo-Alange and that of the Escorialâthis huge\n",

      "knowledge. He borrows Livy's framework, inserting speeches which,\n",
      "if not stenographic reports of what was actually said, are complete\n",
      "illustrations of dramatic motive. He deals with events which he had\n",
      "witnessed: plots which his crafty brain inspired, victories wherein\n",
      "he shared, battles in which he bit the dust. The portraits in his\n",
      "gallery are scarce, but every likeness, is a masterpiece rendered with\n",
      "a few broad strokes. He records with cold-blooded impartiality as a\n",
      "judge; his native austerity, his knowledge of affairs and men, guard\n",

      "as some believe, to his profession as a Franciscan monk. His seventeen\n",
      "surviving songs are all erotic, with the exception of the _Flama del\n",

      "It is impossible to say of Santillana that he was an original genius:\n",
      "it is within bounds to class him as a highly gifted versifier with\n",

      "range of ideas: his attraction lies not so much in what is said as in\n",
      "his trick of saying it. He is one of the few poets whom erudition has\n",
      "not hampered. He was familiar with writers as diverse as Dante and\n",
      "Petrarch and Alain Chartier, and he reproduces their characteristics\n",
      "with a fine exactness and felicity. But he was something more than\n",
      "an intelligent echo, for he filed and laboured till he acquired a\n",
      "final manner of his own. Doubtless to his own taste his forty-two\n",
      "sonnetsâ_fechos al itÃ¡lico modo_, as he proudly tells you were his\n",
      "best titles to glory; and it is true that he acclimatised the sonnet\n",
      "in Spain, sharing with the Aragonese, Juan de Villapando, the honour\n",
      "of being Spain's only sonneteer before BoscÃ¡n's time. Commonplace\n",
      "in thought, stiff in expression, the sonnets are only historically\n",
      "curious. It is in his lighter vein that Santillana reaches his full\n",
      "stature. The grace and gaiety of his _decires_, _serranillas_ and\n",
      "_vaqueiras_ are all his own. If he borrowed suggestions from ProvenÃ§al\n",
      "poets, he is free of the ProvenÃ§al artifice, and sings with the\n",
      "simplicity of Venus' doves. Here he revealed a peculiar aspect of\n",
      "his many-sided temperament, and by his tact made a living thing of\n",
      "primitive emotions, which were to be done to death in the pastorals of\n",
      "heavy-handed bunglers. The first-fruits of the pastoral harvest live in\n",
      "the house where Santillana garnered them, and those roses, amid which\n",

      "The official court-poet of the age was JUAN DE MENA (1411-56), known to\n",
      "his own generation as the \"prince of Castilian poets,\" and Cervantes,\n",
      "writing more than a hundred and fifty years afterwards, dubs him\n",
      "\"that great CÃ³rdoban poet.\" A true son of CÃ³rdoba, Mena has all the\n",
      "qualities of the CÃ³rdoban schoolâthe ostentatious embellishment\n",
      "of his ancestor, Lucan, and the unintelligible preciosity of his\n",
      "descendant, GÃ³ngora. The Italian travels of his youth undid him,\n",
      "and set him on the hopeless line of Italianising Spanish prose. A\n",
      "false attribution enters the Annals of Juan II. under Mena's name:\n",
      "the mere fact that Juan II.'s _CrÃ³nica_ is a model of correct prose\n",
      "disposes of the pretension. Mena's summary of the _Iliad_, and the\n",
      "commentary to his poem the _CoronaciÃ³n_, convict him of being the\n",
      "worst prose-writer in all Castilian literature. Simplicity and\n",
      "vulgarity were for him synonyms, and he carries his doctrine to its\n",
      "logical extreme by adopting impossible constructions, by wrenching\n",
      "his sentences asunder by exaggerated inversions, and by adding absurd\n",
      "Latinisms to his vocabulary. These defects are less grave in his verse,\n",
      "but even there they follow him. Argote de Molina would have him the\n",
      "author of the political satire called the _Coplas de la Panadera_;\n",
      "but Mena lacked the lightness of touch, the wit and sparkle of the\n",
      "imaginary baker's wife. If he be read at all, he is to be studied in\n",
      "his _Laberinto_, also known as the _Trescientas_, a heavy allegory\n",
      "whose deliberate obscurity is indicated by its name. The alternative\n",
      "title, _Trescientas_; is explained by the fact that the poem consisted\n",
      "of three hundred stanzas, to which sixty-five were added by request of\n",
      "the King, who kept the book by him of nights and hankered for a stanza\n",
      "daily, using it, maybe, as a soporific. The poet is whisked by the\n",
      "dragons in Bellona's chariot to Fortune's palace, and there begins the\n",
      "inevitable imitation of Dante, with its machinery of seven planetary\n",
      "circles, and its grandiose vision of past, present, and future. The\n",
      "work of a learned poet taking himself too seriously and straining after\n",
      "effects beyond his reach, the _Laberinto_ is tedious as a whole; yet,\n",
      "though Mena's imagination fails to realise his abstractions, though\n",
      "he be riddled with purposeless conceits, he touches a high level in\n",
      "isolated episodes. Much of his vogue may be accounted for by the\n",
      "abundance with which he throws off striking lines of somewhat hard,\n",
      "even marmoreal beauty, and by the ardent patriotism which inspires\n",
      "him in his best passages. A poet by flashes, at intervals rare and far\n",
      "apart, Mena does himself injustice by too close a devotion to Ã¦sthetic\n",
      "principles, that made failure a certainty. Careful, conscientious,\n",
      "aspiring, he had done far more if he had attempted much less.\n",

      "one Barbier of Orleans. The dates of his birth and death are unknown,\n",

      "that Torres Naharro, having taken orders, was captured by Algerine\n",
      "pirates, was ransomed, and made his way to Rome about the year 1513.\n",
      "Further, we know that he lived at Naples in the service of Fabrizio\n",
      "Colonna, and that his collected plays were published at Naples in\n",
      "1517 with the title of _Propaladia_, dedicated to Francisco DÃ¡valos,\n",
      "the Spanish husband of Vittoria Colonna. That Torres Naharro was a\n",
      "favourite with Leo X. rests on no better basis than the fact that in\n",
      "the Pope's privilege to print he is styled _dilectus filius_.\n",
      "\n",
      "His friendly witness, Barbier, informs us that, though Torres Naharro\n",
      "was quite competent to write his plays in Latin, he chose Castilian of\n",
      "set purpose that \"he might be the first to write in the vulgar tongue.\"\n",
      "This phrase, taken by itself, implies ignorance of Encina's work; in\n",
      "any case, Torres Naharro develops his drama on a larger scale than that\n",
      "of his predecessor. His _Prohemio_ or Preface is full of interesting\n",
      "doctrine. He divides his plays into five acts, because Horace wills it\n",
      "so, and these acts he calls _jornadas_, \"because they resemble so many\n",
      "resting-points.\" The personages should not be too many: not less than\n",
      "six, and not more than twelve. If the writer introduces some twenty\n",
      "characters in his _Tinellaria_, he excuses himself on the ground that\n",
      "\"the subject needed it.\" He further apologises for the introduction\n",
      "of Italian words in his plays: a concession to \"the place where, and\n",
      "the persons to whom, the plays were recited.\" Lastly, Torres Naharro\n",
      "divides dramas into two broad classes: first, the _comedia de noticia_,\n",
      "which treats of events really seen and noted; second, the _comedia de\n",
      "fantasÃ­a_, which deals with feigned things, imaginary incidents that\n",
      "seem true, and might be true, though in fact they are not so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the _comedia de fantasÃ­a_ Torres Naharro is the earliest master. He\n",
      "adventures on the allegorical drama in his _Trofea_, which commemorates\n",
      "the exploits of Manoel of Portugal in Africa and India, and brings Fame\n",
      "and Apollo upon the stage. The chivalresque drama is represented by\n",
      "him in such pieces as the _Serafina_, the _Aquilana_, the _Himenea_;\n",
      "while he examples the play of manners by the _Jacinta_ and the\n",
      "_Soldadesca_. Each piece begins with an _introyto_ or prologue, wherein\n",
      "indulgence and attention are requested; then follows a concise summary\n",
      "of the plot; last, the action opens. The faults of Torres Naharro's\n",
      "theatre are patent enough: his tendency to turn comedy to farce, his\n",
      "inclination to extravagance, his want of tact in crowding his stageâas\n",
      "in the _Tinellaria_âwith half-a-dozen characters chattering in\n",
      "half-a-dozen different languages at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting aside these primitive humours, it is impossible to deny that\n",
      "Torres Naharro has a positive, as well as an historic value. His\n",
      "versification, always in the Castilian octosyllabic metre, with no\n",
      "trespassing on the Italian hendecasyllabic, is neat and polished,\n",
      "and, though far from splendid, lacks neither sweetness nor speed; his\n",
      "dialogue is pointed, opportune, dramatic; his characters are observed\n",
      "and are set in the proper light. His verses entitled the _Lamentaciones\n",
      "de Amor_ are in the old, artificial manner; his satirical couplets\n",
      "on the clergy are vigorous and witty attacks on the general life of\n",
      "Rome; his devout songs are neither better nor worse than those of his\n",
      "contemporaries; and his sonnetsâtwo in Italian, one in a mixture of\n",
      "Italian and Latinâare mere curiosities of no real worth, yet they\n",
      "testify to the writer's uncommon versatility. Versatile Torres Naharro\n",
      "unquestionably was, and his gift serves him in the plays for which he\n",
      "is remembered. He is the first Spaniard to realise his personages, to\n",
      "create character on the boards; the first to build a plot, to maintain\n",
      "an interest of action by variety of incident, to polish an intrigue, to\n",
      "concentrate his powers within manageable limits, to view stage-effects\n",
      "from before the curtain. In a word, Torres Naharro knew the stage,\n",
      "its possibilities, and its resources. For his own age and for his\n",
      "opportunities he knew it even too well; and his _Himenea_âthe theme\n",
      "of which is the love of Himeneo for Febea, with the interposition of\n",
      "Febea's brother, petulant as to the \"point of honour\"âis an isolated\n",
      "masterpiece, unrivalled till the time of Lope de Vega. The accident\n",
      "that Torres Naharro's _Propaladia_ was printed in Italy; the misfortune\n",
      "that its Spanish reprints were tardy, and that his plays were too\n",
      "complicated for the primitive resources of the Spanish stage: these\n",
      "delayed the development of the Spanish theatre by close on a century.\n",
      "Yet the fact remains: to find a match for the _Himenea_ we must pass to\n",
      "the best of Lope's pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the Spaniard in Italy. In Portugal, likewise, he made his way. GIL\n",
      "VICENTE (1470-1540), the Portuguese dramatist, wrote forty-two pieces,\n",
      "of which ten are wholly in Castilian, while fifteen are in a mixed\n",
      "jargon of Castilian and Portuguese which the author himself ridicules\n",
      "as _aravia_ in his _Auto das Fadas_. An important historical fact is\n",
      "that Vicente's earliest dramatic attempt, the _Monologo da VisitaÃ§Ã£o_,\n",
      "is in Castilian, and that it was actually playedâthe first lay piece\n",
      "ever given in Portugalâon June 8, 1502. Its simplicity of tone and\n",
      "elegance of manner are reminiscent of Encina, and it can scarce be\n",
      "doubted that Vicente's imitation is deliberate. Still more obvious\n",
      "is the following of Encina's eclogues in Vicente's _Auto pastoril\n",
      "Castelhano_ and the _Auto dos Reis Magos_, where the legend is treated\n",
      "with Encina's curious touch of devotion and modernity, the whole\n",
      "closing with a song in which all join. Once again Encina's influence\n",
      "is manifest in the _Auto da Sibilla Cassandra_, wherein Cassandra,\n",
      "niece of Moses, Abraham, and Isaiah, is wooed by Solomon. In _AmadÃ­s de\n",
      "Gaula_ and in _Dom Duardos_ there is a marked advance in elaboration\n",
      "and finish; and in the _Auto da FÃ©_ Vicente proves his independence by\n",
      "an ingenuity and a fancy all his own. Here he displays qualities above\n",
      "those of his model, and treats his subject with such brilliancy that,\n",
      "a century and a half later, CalderÃ³n condescended to borrow from the\n",
      "Portuguese the idea of his _auto_ entitled _El Lirio y la Azucena_. Gil\n",
      "Vicente is technically a dramatist, but he is not dramatic as Torres\n",
      "Naharro is dramatic. His action is slight, his treatment timid and\n",
      "conventional, and he is more poetic than inventive; still, his dramatic\n",
      "songs are of singular beauty, conceived in a tone of mystic lyricism\n",
      "unapproached by those who went before him, and surpassed by few who\n",
      "followed. That Vicente was ever played in Spain is not known; but that\n",
      "he influenced both Lope de Vega and CalderÃ³n is as sure as that he\n",

      "ill represented by his _Viaggio fatto in Spagna_. Being at Granada\n",
      "in the year 1526, Navagiero met BoscÃ¡n, who has left us an account\n",
      "of the conversation:â\"Talking of wit and letters, especially of\n",
      "their varieties in different tongues, he inquired why I did not try\n",
      "in Castilian the sonnets and verse-forms favoured by distinguished\n",

      "attempt. Some days later, I made for home, and, because of the length\n",
      "and loneliness of the journey, thinking matters over, I returned to\n",
      "what Navagiero had said, and thus I first attempted this sort of verse;\n",
      "finding it hard at the outset, since it is very intricate, with many\n",

      "\n",
      "His illustrious descent, his ostentatious valour, his splendid\n",
      "presence, his seductive charm, his untimely death: all these, joined\n",
      "to his gift of song, combine to make him the hero of a legend and the\n",
      "idol of a nation. Like Sir Philip Sidney, Garcilaso personified all\n",
      "accomplishments and all graces. He died at thirty-three: the fact must\n",
      "be borne in mind when we take account of his life's work in literature.\n",
      "Yet Europe mourned for him, and the loyal BoscÃ¡n proclaimed his debt\n",

      "encouragement of Garcilaso, whose decisionânot merely to my mind, but\n",
      "to the whole world'sâis to be taken as final. By praising my attempts,\n",
      "by showing the surest sign of approval through his acceptance of my\n",

      "and, more jealous for the fame of her husband's friend than were any of\n",

      "\n",
      "Garcilaso is eminently a poet of refinement, distinction, and\n",
      "cultivation. What BoscÃ¡n half knew, Garcilaso knew to perfection, and\n",
      "his accomplishment was wider as well as deeper.[6] Living his last\n",
      "years in Naples, Garcilaso had caught the right Renaissance spirit, and\n",
      "is beyond all question the most Italianate of Spanish poets in form\n",
      "and substance. He was not merely the associate of such expatriated\n",
      "countrymen as Juan de ValdÃ©s: he was the friend of Bembo and Tansillo,\n",
      "the first of whom calls him the best loved and the most welcome of\n",
      "all the Spaniards that ever came to Italy. To Tansillo, Garcilaso was\n",
      "attached by bonds of closest intimacy, and the reciprocal influence\n",
      "of the one upon the other is manifest in the works of both. This\n",
      "association would seem to have been the chief part of Garcilaso's\n",
      "literary training. His few flights in the old Castilian metres, his\n",
      "songs and _villancicos_, are of small importance; his finest efforts\n",
      "are cast in the exotic moulds. It is scarcely an exaggeration to say\n",
      "that fundamentally he is a Neapolitan poet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sum of his production is slight: the inconsiderable _villancicos_,\n",
      "three eclogues, two elegies, an epistle, five highly elaborated songs,\n",
      "and thirty-eight Petrarchan sonnets. Small as is his work in bulk,\n",
      "it cannot be denied that it was like nothing before it in Castilian.\n",
      "AuzÃ­as March, no doubt, had earlier struck a similar note in Catalan,\n",
      "and Garcilaso, who seems to have read everything, imitates his\n",
      "predecessor's harmonies and cadences. His trick of reminiscence is\n",
      "remarkable. Thus, his first eclogue is plainly suggested by Tansillo;\n",
      "his second eclogue is little more than a rendering in verse of picked\n",
      "passages from the _Arcadia_ of Jacopo Sannazaro; while the fifth of\n",
      "his songsâ_La Flor de Gnido_âis a most masterly transplantation of\n",
      "Bernardo Tasso's structure to Castilian soil. And almost every page is\n",
      "touched with the deliberate, conscious elegance of a student in the\n",
      "school of Horace. In simple execution Garcilaso is impeccable. The\n",
      "objection most commonly made is that he surrenders his personality, and\n",
      "converts himself into the exquisite echo of an exhausted pseudo-classic\n",
      "convention. And the charge is plausible.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is undeniably true that Garcilaso's distinction lacks the force\n",
      "of real simplicity, that his eternal sweetness cloys, and that the\n",
      "thing said absorbs him less than the manner of saying it. He would\n",
      "have met the criticism that he was an artificial poet by pointing\n",
      "out that, poetry being an art, it is of essence artificial. That he\n",
      "was an imitative artist was his highest glory: by imitating foreign\n",
      "models he attained his measure of originality, enriching Spain, with\n",
      "not merely a number of technical forms but a new poetic language.\n",
      "Without him BoscÃ¡n must have failed in his emprise, as Santillana\n",
      "failed before him. Besides his technical perfection, Garcilaso owned\n",
      "the poetic temperamentâa temperament too effeminately delicate for the\n",
      "vulgarities of life. As he tells us in his third eclogue, he lived,\n",
      "\"now using the sword, now the pen:\"â\n",

      "returning upon nature; not upon the material facts of existence as it\n",
      "is, but upon a figmentary nature idealised into a languid and ethereal\n",
      "beauty. He sought for effects of suavest harmony, embodying in his song\n",
      "a mystic neo-platonism, the _morbidezza_ of \"love in the abstract,\" set\n",
      "off by grace and sensibility and elfin music. It may be permissible\n",

      "being holy and pious. But of these Christian virtues they are not\n",

      "hope, and charity, and so are pious, holy, and just in Christ.\" The\n",
      "Arian flavour of this work explains its non-appearance in Castilian,\n",
      "and we must suppose that Herbert esteemed it for its austere doctrinal\n",
      "asceticism rather than its crude anti-trinitarianism. A Quaker before\n",
      "his time, ValdÃ©s owes no small part of his recent vogue to Wiffen, who\n",

      "by a Spaniard, which represented essentially the principles of George\n",

      "innermost recesses of the human heart.\n",

      "In another and a less contested field, we owe to ValdÃ©s the admirable\n",

      "are four: two Italians, named Marcio and Coriolano; and two Spaniards,\n",
      "ValdÃ©s himself, and a Spanish soldier, called indifferently Pacheco\n",
      "and Torres. For all purposes this dialogue is as important a monument\n",
      "of literary criticism as was the conversation in Don Quixote's library\n",
      "between the Priest and the Barber. In almost every case posterity has\n",
      "ratified the personal verdict of ValdÃ©s, who approves himself the\n",

      "the unwearied sagacity, the patrician wit and disdainful coolness of\n",

      "between Torubio and his wife Ãgueda concerning the price of olives not\n",

      "published by his friend, Juan de Timoneda. In a longer flight the\n",
      "effect is less pleasing; the prose _Coloquio de Camila_ and its fellow,\n",

      "and vigorous style. Rueda had clearly read the _Celestina_ to his\n",

      "and power. The patriotic Lista comes as near flat blasphemy as a good\n",
      "Spaniard may by mentioning Rueda in the same breath as Cervantes, and\n",
      "that the latter learned much from his predecessor is manifest; but the\n",
      "point need be pressed no further. Considerable as were Rueda's positive\n",

      "\n",
      "\"A man is directed to make a garden in a bad soil overrun with sour\n",
      "grasses. The Lord of the land roots out the weeds, sows seeds, and\n",
      "plants herbs and fruit-trees. The gardener must then care for them\n",
      "and water them, that they may thrive and blossom, and that the Lord\n",
      "may find pleasure in his garden and come to visit it. There are four\n",
      "ways in which the watering may be done. There is water which is drawn\n",
      "wearily by hand from the well. There is water drawn by the ox-wheel,\n",
      "more abundantly and with greater labour. There is water brought in\n",
      "from the river, which will saturate the whole ground; and, last and\n",
      "best, there is rain from heaven. Four sorts of prayer correspond to\n",
      "these. The first is a weary effort with small returns; the well may run\n",
      "dry: the gardener then must weep. The second is internal prayer and\n",
      "meditation upon God; the trees will then show leaves and flower-buds.\n",
      "The third is love of God. The virtues then become vigorous. We converse\n",
      "with God face to face. The flowers open and give out fragrance. The\n",
      "fourth kind cannot be described in words. Then there is no more toil,\n",
      "and the seasons no longer change; flowers are always blowing, and\n",
      "fruit ripens perennially. The soul enjoys undoubting certitude; the\n",
      "faculties work without effort and without consciousness; the heart\n",
      "loves and does not know that it loves; the mind perceives, yet does\n",
      "not know that it perceives. If the butterfly pauses to say to itself\n",
      "how prettily it is flying, the shining wings fall off, and it drops\n",
      "and dies. The life of the spirit is not our life, but the life of God\n",

      "And, as Santa Teresa excelled in spiritual insight, so she has the\n",
      "sense of affairs. Durtal, in M. Joris-Karl Huysmans' _En Route_, first\n",
      "says of her:â\"Sainte TÃ©rÃ¨se a explorÃ© plus Ã  fond que tout autre\n",
      "les rÃ©gions inconnues de l'Ã¢me; elle en est, en quelque sorte, la\n",
      "gÃ©ographe; elle a surtout dressÃ© la carte de ses pÃ´les, marquÃ© les\n",
      "latitudes contemplatives, les terres intÃ©rieures du ciel humain.\"\n",
      "And he shows the reverse of the medal:â\"Mais quel singulier mÃ©lange\n",
      "elle montre aussi, d'une mystique ardente et d'une femme d'affaires\n",
      "froide; car, enfin, elle est Ã  double fond; elle est contemplative hors\n",
      "le monde et elle est Ã©galement un homme d'Ã©tat: elle est le Colbert\n",
      "fÃ©minin des cloÃ®tres.\" The key to Durtal's difficulties is given in\n",
      "the AbbÃ© GÃ©vresin's remark, that the perfect balance of good sense is\n",
      "one of the distinctive signs of the mystics. In Santa Teresa's case\n",
      "the sign is present. An uninquiring world may choose to think of her\n",
      "as a fanatic in vapours and in ecstasies. Yet it is she who writes,\n",
      "in the _Camino de PerfecciÃ³n_:â\"I would not have my daughters be, or\n",
      "seem to be, women in anything, but brave men.\" It is she who holds\n",
      "that \"of revelations no account should be made\"; who calls the usual\n",
      "convent life \"a shortcut to hell\"; who adds that \"if parents took my\n",
      "advice, they would rather marry their daughters to the poorest of\n",
      "men, or keep them at home under their own eyes.\" Her position as a\n",
      "spiritual force is as unique as her place in literature. It is certain\n",
      "that her \"own dear books\" were nothing to her; that she regarded\n",
      "literature as frivolity; and no one questions her right so to regard\n",
      "it. But the world also is entitled to its judgment, which is expressed\n",
      "in different ways. Jeremy Taylor cites her in a sermon preached at the\n",
      "opening of the Parliament of Ireland (May 8, 1661). Protestant England,\n",
      "by the mouth of Froude, compares Santa Teresa to Cervantes. Catholic\n",
      "Spain places her manuscript of her own _Life_ beside a page of St.\n",
      "Augustine's writing in the Palace of the Escorial.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some sense we may almost consider the Ecstatic Doctor, SAN JUAN DE\n",
      "LA CRUZ (1542-91), as one of Santa Teresa's disciples. He changed his\n",
      "worldly name of Juan de Yepes y Ãlvarez for that of Juan de la Cruz\n",
      "on joining the Carmelite order in 1563. Shortly afterwards he made\n",
      "the acquaintance of Santa Teresa, and, fired by her enthusiasm, he\n",
      "undertook to carry out in monasteries the reforms which she introduced\n",
      "in convents. In his _Obras espirituales_ (1618) mysticism finds its\n",
      "highest expression. There are moments when his prose style is of\n",
      "extreme clearness and force, but in many cases he soars to heights\n",
      "where the sense reels in the attempt to follow him. St. John of the\n",

      "what for most men must remain a mystery. Yet in his verse one seizes\n",

      "was born. We shall have occasion to refer to her later. Our immediate\n",
      "concern is with the _Primera Parte de Galatea_, an unfinished pastoral\n",
      "novel in six books, for which Cervantes received 1336 _reales_ from\n",
      "Blas de Robles; a sum which, with his wife's small dowry, enabled him\n",
      "to start housekeeping.[17] As a financial speculation the _Galatea_\n",
      "failed: only two later editions appeared during the writer's lifetime,\n",
      "one at Lisbon in 1590, the other at Paris in 1611. Neither could have\n",
      "brought him money; but the book, if it did nothing else, served to make\n",
      "him known.\n",
      "\n",
      "He trimmed his sails to the popular breeze. MontemÃ´r had started\n",
      "the pastoral fashion, PÃ©rez and Gaspar Gil Polo had followed, and\n",

      "Berganza say that all pastorals are \"vain imaginings, void of truth,\n",
      "written to amuse the idle\"; yet it may be doubted if Cervantes ever\n",
      "lost the pastoral taste, though his sense of humour forced him to see\n",
      "the absurdity of the convention. It is very certain that he had a\n",
      "special fondness for the _Galatea_: he spared it at the burning of Don\n",
      "Quixote's library, praised its invention, and made the Priest exhort\n",
      "the Barber to await the sequel which is foreshadowed in the _Galatea's_\n",
      "text. This is again promised in the Dedication of the volume of plays\n",
      "(1615), in the Prologue to the Second Part of _Don Quixote_ (1615),\n",
      "and in the Letter Dedicatory of _Persiles y Sigismunda_, signed on\n",
      "the writer's deathbed, April 19, 1616. For thirty-one years Cervantes\n",
      "held out the promise of the _Galatea's_ Second Part: five times did he\n",
      "repeat it. It is plain that he thought well of the First, and that his\n",
      "liking for the _genre_ was incorrigible.\n",
      "\n",
      "His own attempt survives chiefly because of the name on its\n",
      "title-page. Pastorals differ little in essentials, and the kind offers\n",
      "few openings to Cervantes' peculiar humoristic genius. Like his\n",
      "fellow-practitioners, he crowds his stage with figures: he presents his\n",
      "shepherds Elicio and Erastro warbling their love for Galatea on Tagus\n",
      "bank; he reveals Mirenio enamoured of Silveria, Leonarda love-sick\n",
      "for Salercio, Lenio in the toils of Gelasia. Hazlitt, in his harsh\n",
      "criticism of Sidney's _Arcadia_, hits the defects of the pastoral, and\n",
      "his censures may be justly applied to the _Galatea_. There, as in the\n",
      "English book, we find the \"original sin of alliteration, antithesis,\n",
      "and metaphysical conceit\"; there, too, is the \"systematic interpolation\n",
      "of the wit, learning, ingenuity, wisdom, and everlasting impertinence\n",
      "of the writer.\" Worst of all are \"the continual, uncalled-for\n",
      "interruptions, analysing, dissecting, disjointing, murdering\n",
      "everything, and reading a pragmatical, self-sufficient lecture over the\n",
      "dead body of nature.\" But if Cervantes sins in this wise, he sins of\n",
      "set purpose and in good company. In his Fourth Book, he interpolates a\n",
      "long disquisition on the Beautiful which he calmly annexes from Judas\n",
      "Abarbanel's _Dialoghi_. As Sannazaro opens his _Arcadia_ with Ergasto\n",
      "and Selvaggio, so Cervantes thrusts his Elicio and Erastro into the\n",
      "foreground of the _Galatea_; the funeral of Meliso is a deliberate\n",
      "imitation of the Feast of Pales; and, as the Italian introduced\n",
      "Carmosina Bonifacia under the name of Amaranta, the Spaniard perforce\n",
      "gives Catalina de Palacios Salazar as Galatea. Nor does he depart\n",
      "from the convention by placing himself upon the scene as Elicio, for\n",
      "Ribeiro and MontemÃ´r had preceded him in the characters of Bimnardel\n",
      "and Sereno. Lastly, the idea and the form of the _Canto de CalÃ­ope_,\n",
      "wherein the uncritical poet celebrates whole tribes of contemporary\n",
      "singers, are borrowed from the _Canto del Turia_, which Gil Polo had\n",
      "interpolated in his _Diana_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prolixity, artifice, ostentation, monotony, extravagance, are\n",
      "inherent in the pastoral school; and the _Galatea_ savours of these\n",
      "defects. Yet, for all its weakness, it lacks neither imagination nor\n",
      "contrivance, and its embroidered rhetoric is a fine example of stately\n",
      "prose. Save, perhaps, in the _Persiles y Sigismunda_, Cervantes never\n",
      "wrote with a more conscious effort after excellence, and, in results\n",
      "of absolute style, the _Galatea_ may compare with all but exceptional\n",
      "passages in _Don Quixote_. Yet it failed to please, and the author\n",
      "turned to other fields of effort. His verses in Pedro de Padilla's\n",
      "_JardÃ­n Espiritual_ (1585) and in LÃ³pez Maldonado's _Cancionero_ (1586)\n",
      "denote good-nature and a love of literature; and in both volumes\n",
      "Cervantes may have read companion-pieces written by a marvellous youth,\n",
      "Lope de Vega, whom he had already praisedâas he praised everybodyâin\n",
      "the _Canto de CalÃ­ope_. He could not foresee that in the person of\n",
      "this boy he was to meet his match and more. Meanwhile in 1587 he\n",
      "penned sonnets for Padilla's _Grandezas y Excelencias de la Virgen_,\n",
      "and for Alonso de Barros' _FilosofÃ­a cortesana_. Verse-making was his\n",
      "craze; and, in 1588, when the physician, Francisco DÃ­az, published a\n",
      "treatise on kidney diseaseâ_Tratado nuevamente impreso acerca de las\n",
      "enfermedades de los riÃ±ones_âthe unwearied poetaster was forthcoming\n",
      "with a sonnet pat to the strange occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, though he cultivated verse with as sedulous a passion as Don\n",
      "Quixote spent on Knight-Errantries, he recognised that man does not\n",
      "live by sonneteering alone, and he tried his fate upon the boards. He\n",
      "died with the happy conviction that he was a dramatist of genius; his\n",
      "contemporaries ruled the point against him, and posterity has upheld\n",
      "the decision. He tells us that at this time he wrote between twenty and\n",
      "thirty plays. We only know the titles of a few among themâthe _Gran\n",
      "Turquesca_, the _JerusalÃ©n_, the _Batalla Naval_ (attributed by MoratÃ­n\n",
      "to the year 1584), the _Amaranta_ and the _Bosque Amoroso_ (referred\n",
      "to 1586), the _Arsinda_ and the _Confusa_ (to 1587). It is like enough\n",
      "that the _Batalla Naval_ was concerned with Lepanto, a subject of which\n",
      "Cervantes never tired; the _Arsinda_ existed so late as 1673, when Juan\n",
      "de Matos Fragoso mentioned it as \"famous\" in his _Corsaria Catalana_;\n",
      "and our author himself ranked the _Confusa_ as \"good among the best.\"\n",
      "The touch of self-complacency is amusing, though one might desire a\n",
      "better security than Bardolph's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two surviving plays of the period are _El Trato de Argel_ and _La\n",
      "Numancia_, first printed by Antonio de Sancha in 1784. The former deals\n",
      "with the life of the Christian slaves in Algiers, and recounts the\n",
      "passion of Zara the Moor for the captive Aurelio, who is enamoured of\n",
      "Silvia. We must assume that Cervantes thought well of this invention,\n",
      "since he utilised it some thirty years later in _El Amante Liberal_;\n",
      "but the play is merely futile. The introduction of a lion, of the\n",
      "Devil, and of such abstractions as Necessity and Opportunity, is as\n",
      "poor a piece of machinery as theatre ever saw; the versification\n",
      "is rough and creaking, improvised without care or conscience; the\n",
      "situations are arranged with a glaring disregard for truth and\n",
      "probability. Like Paolo Veronese, Cervantes could rarely resist the\n",
      "temptation of painting himself into his canvas, and in _El Trato de\n",
      "Argel_ he takes care that the prisoner Saavedra should declaim his\n",
      "tirade. The piece has no dramatic interest, and is valuable merely\n",
      "as an over-coloured picture of vicissitudes by one who knew them at\n",
      "first-hand, and who presented them to his countrymen with a more or\n",
      "less didactic intention. Yet, even as a transcript of manners, this\n",
      "luckless play is a failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "A finer example of Cervantes' dramatic power is the _Numancia_, on\n",
      "which Shelley has passed this generous judgment:â\"I have read the\n",
      "_Numancia_, and, after wading through the singular stupidity of the\n",
      "First Act, began to be greatly delighted, and at length interested in\n",
      "a very high degree, by the power of the writer in awakening pity and\n",
      "admiration, in which I hardly know by whom he is excelled. There is\n",
      "little, I allow, to be called _poetry_ in this play; but the command\n",
      "of language and the harmony of versification is so great as to deceive\n",
      "one into an idea that it is poetry.\" Nor is Shelley alone in his\n",
      "admiration. Goethe's avowal to Humboldt is on record:â\"Sogar habe\n",
      "ich ... neulich das Trauerspiel _Numancia_ von Cervantes mit vielem\n",
      "VergnÃ¼gen gelesen;\" but eight years later he confided a revised\n",
      "judgment to Riemer. The gushing school of German Romantics waxed\n",
      "delirious in praise. Thus Friedrich Schlegel surpassed himself by\n",
      "calling the play \"godlike\"; and August Schlegel, not content to hold it\n",
      "for a dramatic masterpiece, would persuade us to accept it for great\n",
      "poetry. Even Sismondi declares that \"le frisson de l'horreur et de\n",
      "l'effroi devient presque un supplice pour le spectateur.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Raptures apart, the _Numancia_ is Cervantes' best play. He has a\n",
      "grandiose subject: the siege of Numantia, and its capture by Scipio\n",
      "Africanus after fourteen years of resistance. On the Roman side were\n",
      "eighty thousand soldiers; the Spaniards numbered four thousand or less;\n",
      "and the victors entered the fallen city to find no soul alive. With\n",
      "scenes of valour is mingled the pathetic love-story of Morandro and\n",
      "Lyra. But, once again, Cervantes fails as a dramatic artist; one doubts\n",
      "if he knew what a plot was, what unity of conception meant. He has\n",
      "scenes and episodes of high excellence, but they are detached from the\n",
      "main composition, and produce all the bad effect of a portrait painted\n",
      "in different lights. Abstractions fill the stageâWar, Sickness,\n",
      "Hunger, Spain, the river Duero. But the tirades of rhetoric are\n",
      "unsurpassed by anything from Cervantes' pen, and Marquino's scene with\n",
      "the corpse in the Second Act is pregnant with a suggestion of weirdness\n",

      "Here, once more, we are dealing with a passage which gains by\n",
      "detachment from its context. To speak plainly, the interest of the\n",
      "_Numancia_ is not dramatic, and its versification, good of its kind,\n",
      "may easily be overpraised, as it was by Shelley. First and last, the\n",
      "play is a devout and passionate expression of patriotism; and, as\n",
      "such, the writer's countrymen have held it in esteem, never claiming\n",
      "for it the qualities invented by well-meaning foreigners. Lope de Vega\n",
      "and CalderÃ³n still hold the stage, from which Cervantes, the disciple\n",
      "of ViruÃ©s, was driven three centuries ago; and they survive, the one\n",
      "as an hundredfold more potent dramatist, the other as an infinitely\n",
      "greater poet. Yet, like the ghost raised by Marquino, Cervantes was\n",
      "to undergo a momentary resurrection. When Palafox (and Byron's Maid)\n",
      "held Zaragoza, during the War of Independence, against the batteries\n",
      "of Mortier, Junot, and Lannes, the _Numancia_ was played within the\n",
      "besieged walls, so that Spaniards of the nineteenth century might see\n",
      "that their fathers had known how to die for freedom. The tragedy was\n",
      "received with enthusiasm; the marshals of the world's Greatest Captain\n",
      "were repulsed and beaten; and Cervantes' inspiriting lines helped on\n",
      "the victory. In life, he had never met with such a triumph, and in\n",
      "death no other could have pleased him better.\n",
      "\n",
      "He asserts, indeed, that his plays were popular, and he may have\n",
      "persuaded himself into that belief. His idolaters preach the legend\n",
      "that he was driven from the boards by that \"portent of genius,\" Lope\n",
      "de Vega. This tale is a vain imagining. Cervantes failed so wretchedly\n",
      "in art that in 1588 he left the Madrid stage to seek work in Seville;\n",
      "and no play of Lope's dates so early as that, save one written while\n",
      "he was at school. In June 1588, Cervantes became Deputy-Purveyor to\n",
      "the Invincible Armada, and in May 1590 he petitioned for one of four\n",
      "appointments vacant in Granada, Guatemala, Cartagena, and La Paz. But\n",
      "he never quite abandoned literature. In 1591 he wrote a _romance_\n",
      "for AndrÃ©s de Villalba's _Flor de varios y nuevos romances_, and, in\n",
      "the following year, he contracted with the Seville manager, Rodrigo\n",
      "Osorio, to write six comedies at fifty ducats eachâno money to be paid\n",
      "unless Osorio should rank the plays \"among the best in Spain.\" No more\n",
      "is heard of this agreement, and Cervantes disappears till 1594, when\n",
      "he was appointed tax-gatherer in Granada. Next year he competed at a\n",
      "literary tournament held by the Dominicans of Zaragoza in honour of\n",
      "St. Hyacinth, and won the first prizeâthree silver spoons. His sonnet\n",
      "to the famous sea-dog, Santa Cruz, is printed in CristÃ³bal Mosquera\n",
      "de Figueroa's _Comentario en breve Compendio de Disciplina militar_\n",

      "already sacked and evacuated by Essex, is of the same date.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1597, being in Seville about the time of Herrera's death, Cervantes\n",
      "wrote his sonnet in memory of the great AndalucÃ­an. In September of\n",

      "months later, Cervantes was sent packing by the Treasury, and was never\n",
      "more employed in the public service. Lost, as it seemed, to hope and\n",
      "fame, the ruined man lingered at Seville, where, in 1598, he wrote two\n",
      "sonnets and a copy of _quintillas_ on Felipe II.'s death. Four years of\n",
      "silence were followed by the inevitable sonnet in the second edition of\n",
      "Lope de Vega's _Dragontea_ (1602). It is certain that all this while\n",
      "Cervantes was scribbling in some naked garret; but his name seemed\n",
      "almost forgotten from the earth. In 1603 he was run to ground, and\n",
      "served with an Exchequer writ concerning those outstanding balances,\n",
      "still unpaid after nearly eight years. He must appear in person at\n",
      "Valladolid to offer what excuse he might. Light as his baggage was,\n",
      "it contained one precious, immediate jewelâthe manuscript of _Don\n",
      "Quixote_. The Treasury soon found that to squeeze money from him was\n",
      "harder than to draw blood from a stone: the debt remained unsettled.\n",
      "But his journey was not in vain. On his way to Valladolid, he found a\n",
      "publisher for _Don Quixote_. The Royal Privilege is dated September\n",
      "26, 1604, and in January 1605 the book was sold at Madrid across the\n",
      "counter of Francisco de Robles, bookseller to the King. Cervantes\n",
      "dedicated his volume, in terms boldly filched from Herrera and Medina,\n",
      "to the Duque de BÃ©jar. In a previous age the author's kinsman had\n",

      "\n",
      "It is difficult to say when _Don Quixote_ was written; later,\n",
      "certainly, than 1591, for it alludes to Bernardo de la Vega's _Pastor\n",
      "de Iberia_, published in that year. Legend says that the First Part\n",
      "was begun in gaol, and so Langford includes it in his _Prison Books\n",
      "and their Authors_. The only ground for the belief is a phrase in the\n",
      "Prologue which describes the work as \"a dry, shrivelled, whimsical\n",
      "offspring ... just what might be begotten in a prison.\" This may be a\n",
      "mere figure of speech; yet the tradition persists that Cervantes wrote\n",
      "his masterpiece in the cellar of the Casa de Medrano at Argamasilla de\n",
      "Alba. Certain it is that Argamasilla is Don Quixote's native town. The\n",
      "burlesque verses at the end indicate precisely that \"certain village\n",
      "in La Mancha, the name of which,\" says Cervantes dryly, \"I have no\n",

      "Shakespeare, whose death is dated by an unreformed calendar. They were\n",

      "\"prodigy of nature,\" as his rival confesses. A prodigy he was from his\n",
      "cradle. At the age of five he lisped in numbers, and, unable to write,\n",
      "would bribe his schoolmates with a share of his breakfast to take down\n",
      "verses at his dictation. He came of noble highland blood, his father,\n",

      "Carriedo. Born in Madrid, he was there educated at the Jesuit Colegio\n",
      "Imperial, of which he was the wonder. All the accomplishments were his:\n",
      "still a child, he filled his copy-books with verses, sang, danced,\n",
      "handled the foil like a trained sworder. His father, a poet of some\n",
      "accomplishment, died early, and Lope forthwith determined to see the\n",
      "world. With his comrade, Hernando MuÃ±oz, he ran away from school. The\n",
      "pair reached Astorga, and turned back to Segovia, where, being short\n",
      "of money, they tried to sell a chain to a jeweller, who, suspecting\n",
      "something to be wrong, informed the local Dogberry. The adventurous\n",

      "The chronology of Lope's youth is perplexing, and the events of this\n",
      "time are, as a rule, wrongly given by his biographers, even including\n",
      "that admirable scholar, Cayetano Alberto de la Barrera y Leirado,\n",
      "whose _Nueva BiografÃ­a_ is almost above praise. In a poetic epistle\n",
      "to Luis de Haro, Lope asserts that he fought at Terceira against\n",
      "the Portuguese: \"in my third lustre\"â_en tres lustros de mi edad\n",
      "primera_: and Ticknor is puzzled to reconcile this with facts. It\n",
      "cannot be done. Lope was fifteen in 1577, and the expedition to the\n",
      "Azores occurred in 1582. The obvious explanation is that Lope was in\n",
      "his fourth lustre, but that, as _cuatro_ would break the rhythm of\n",
      "the line, he wrote _tres_ instead. Some little licence is admitted in\n",
      "verse, and literal interpreters are peculiarly liable to error. At\n",
      "the same time, it should be said that Lope is coquettish as regards\n",
      "his age. Thus, he says that he was a child at the time of the Armada,\n",
      "being really twenty-six; and that he wrote the _Dragontea_ in early\n",
      "youth, when, in fact, he was thirty-five. This little vanity has led to\n",
      "endless confusion. It is commonly stated that, on Lope's return from\n",
      "the Azores, he entered the household of GerÃ³nimo Manrique, Bishop of\n",
      "Ãvila, who sent him to AlcalÃ¡ de Henares. That Lope studied at AlcalÃ¡\n",
      "is certain; but undergraduates then matriculated earlier than they do\n",
      "now. When Lope's first campaign ended he was twenty-one, and therefore\n",
      "too old for college. He was a Bachelor before ever he went to the\n",
      "wars. The love-affair, recounted in his _Dorotea_, is commonly said to\n",
      "have prevented his taking orders at AlcalÃ¡: in truth, he never saw the\n",
      "lady till he came back from the Azores! He became private secretary to\n",
      "Antonio Ãlvarez de Toledo y Beaumont, fifth Duque de Alba, and grandson\n",
      "of the great soldier; but the date cannot be given precisely. As far\n",
      "back as 1572 he had translated Claudian's _Rape of Proserpine_ into\n",
      "Castilian verse, and we have already seen him joined with Cervantes in\n",
      "penning complimentary sonnets for Padilla and LÃ³pez Maldonado (1584).\n",
      "It may be that, while in Alba's service, he wrote the poems printed in\n",
      "Pedro de Moncayo's _Flor de varios romances_ (1589).\n",
      "\n",
      "The history of these years is obscure. It is usually asserted that,\n",
      "while in Alba's service, about the year 1584-5, Lope married, and\n",
      "that he was soon afterwards exiled to Valencia, whence he set out\n",
      "for Lisbon to join the Invincible Armada. This does not square with\n",
      "Lope's statement in the Dedication of _Querer la propia Desdicha_ to\n",
      "Claudio Conde. There he alleges that Conde helped him out of prison\n",
      "in Madrid, a service repaid by his helping Conde out of the Serranos\n",
      "prison at Valencia, and he goes on to say that \"before the first down\n",
      "was on their cheeks\" they went to Lisbon to embark on the Armada. He\n",
      "nowhere alleges that they started from Valencia, or that the journey\n",
      "followed the banishment. In an eclogue to the same Conde, Lope avers\n",
      "that he joined the Armada to escape from Filis (otherwise Dorotea),\n",
      "and he adds:â\"Who could have thought that, returning from the war,\n",
      "I should find a sweet wife?\" The question would be pointless if Lope\n",
      "were already married. Moreover, Barrera's theory that the intrigue\n",
      "with Dorotea ended in 1584 is disproved by the fact that the _Dorotea_\n",
      "contains allusions to the Conde de Melgar's marriage, which, as we know\n",
      "from Cabrera, took place in 1587. What is certain is that Lope went\n",
      "aboard the _San Juan_, and that during the Armada expedition he used\n",
      "his manuscript verses in Filis's praise for gun-wads.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a first-class fighting-man, and played his part in the combats\n",
      "up the Channel, where his brother was killed beside him during an\n",
      "encounter between the _San Juan_ and eight Dutch vessels. Disaster\n",
      "never quenched his spirit nor stayed his pen; for, when what was left\n",
      "of the defeated Armada returned to CÃ¡diz, he landed with the greater\n",
      "part of his _Hermosura de AngÃ©lica_âeleven thousand verses, written\n",
      "between storm and battle, in continuation of the _Orlando Furioso_.\n",
      "First published in 1602, the _AngÃ©lica_ comes short of Ariosto's epic\n",
      "nobility, and is unrelieved by the Italian's touch of ironic fantasy.\n",
      "Nor can it be called successful even as a sequel: its very wealth\n",
      "of invention, its redundant episodes and innumerable digressions,\n",
      "contribute to its failure. But the verse is singularly brilliant and\n",
      "effective, while the skill with which the writer handles proper names\n",
      "is almost Miltonic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Returned to Spain, Lope composed his pastoral novel, the _Arcadia_,\n",
      "which, however, remained unpublished till 1598. Ticknor believed it \"to\n",
      "have been written almost immediately\" after Cervantes' _Galatea_: this\n",
      "cannot be, for the _Arcadia_ refers to the death of Santa Cruz, which\n",
      "occurred in 1588, and it discusses in the conventional manner Alba's\n",
      "love-affairs of 1589-90. The _Arcadia_, where Lope figures as Belardo,\n",
      "and Alba as Amfriso, makes no pretence to be a transcript of manners\n",
      "or life, and it is intolerably prolix withal. Yet it goes beyond its\n",
      "fellows by virtue of its vivid landscapes, its graceful, flowing verse,\n",
      "and a certain rich, poetic, Latinized prose, here used by Lope with\n",
      "as much artistry as he showed in his management of the more familiar\n",
      "kind in the _Dorotea_. Its popularity is proved by the publication\n",
      "of fifteen editions in its author's lifetime. About the year 1590 he\n",
      "married Isabel de Urbina, a distant connection of Cervantes' mother,\n",
      "and daughter of Felipe II.'s King-at-Arms. Hereupon followed a duel,\n",
      "wherein Lope wounded his adversary, and, earlier escapades being raked\n",
      "up, he was banished the capital. He spent some time in Valencia, a\n",
      "considerable literary centre; but in 1594 he signed the manuscript of\n",
      "his play, _El Maestro de danzar_, at Tormes, Alba's estate, whence\n",
      "it is inferred that he was once more in the Duke's service. A new\n",
      "love-affair with Antonia Trillo de Armenta brought legal troubles upon\n",
      "him in 1596. His wife apparently died in 1597.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first considerable work printed with Lope's name upon the\n",
      "title-page was his _Dragontea_ (1598), an epic poem in ten cantos\n",
      "on the last cruise and death of Francis Drake. We naturally love to\n",
      "think of the mighty seaman as the patriot, the chiefest of Britannia's\n",
      "bulwarks, as he figures in Mr. Newbolt's spirited ballad:â\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"_Drake lies in his hammock till the great Armadas come ...\n",
      "  Slung atween the round shot, listenin' for the drum ...\n",

      "    Call him when ye sail to meet the foe;\n",

      "    They shall find him 'ware an' waking, as they found him long ago._\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Odd to say, though, Lope has been censured for not viewing Drake\n",
      "through English Protestant spectacles. Seeing that he was a good\n",
      "Catholic Spaniard whom Drake had drummed up the Channel, it had been\n",
      "curious if the _Dragontea_ were other than it is: a savage denunciation\n",
      "of that Babylonian Dragon, that son of the devil whose piracies had\n",
      "tormented Spain during thirty years. The _Dragontea_ fails not because\n",
      "of its national spirit, which is wholly admirable, but because of its\n",
      "excessive emphasis and its abuse of allegory. Its author scarcely\n",
      "intended it for great poetry; but, as a patriotic screed, it fulfilled\n",
      "its purpose, and, when reprinted, it drew an approving sonnet from\n",
      "Cervantes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The _Dragontea_ was written while Lope was in the household of the\n",

      "which he had achieved with the prose of the _Arcadia_. From this day\n",
      "forward he was the admitted pontiff of Spanish literature. His marriage\n",

      "dramatic effects, substitutes characters for abstractions, and, in\n",
      "a word, expresses the genius of a people. It is true that he rarely\n",
      "finds a perfect form for his utterance, that he constantly approaches\n",
      "perfection without quite attaining unto it, that his dramatic instinct\n",
      "exceeds his literary execution. Yet he survives as the creator of\n",

      "in publishing his plays, though _El Perseguido_ was issued by a Lisbon\n",

      "Of the Aragonese playwright, Lupercio Leonardo de Argensola, we have\n",
      "already spoken in a previous chapter. His brother, BARTOLOMÃ LEONARDO\n",
      "DE ARGENSOLA (1562-1631), took orders, and, through the influence of\n",
      "the Duque de Villahermosa, was named rector of the town whence his\n",
      "patron took his title. His earliest work, the _Conquista de las Islas\n",
      "Molucas_ (1609), written by order of the Conde de Lemos, is uncritical\n",
      "in conception and design; but the matter of its primitive, romantic,\n",
      "and even sentimental legends derives fresh charm from the author's apt\n",
      "and polished narrative. In 1611 he and his brother accompanied Lemos\n",
      "to Naples, thereby stirring the anger of Cervantes, who had hoped to\n",
      "be among the Viceroy's suite, as appears from a passage in the _Viaje\n",
      "del Parnaso_, which roundly insinuates that the Argensolas were a\n",
      "pair of intriguers. The disappointment was natural; yet posterity is\n",
      "even grateful for it, since a transfer to Naples would certainly have\n",
      "lost us the second _Don Quixote_. Doubtless the Argensolas, who were\n",
      "of Italian descent, were better fitted than Cervantes for commerce\n",
      "with Italian affairs, and BartolomÃ© made friends on all sides in\n",
      "Naples as in Rome. On his brother's death in 1613, he became official\n",
      "chronicler of AragÃ³n, and, in 1631, published a sequel to _Zurita_,\n",
      "the _Anales de AragÃ³n_, which deals so minutely with the events of the\n",
      "years 1516-20 as to become wearisome, despite all Argensola's grace of\n",
      "manner. The _Rimas_ of the two brothers, published posthumously in 1634\n",
      "by Lupercio's son, Gabriel Leonardo de AlbiÃ³n, was stamped with the\n",
      "approval of the dictator, Lope de Vega, who declared that the authors\n",

      "which is suffering from new horrible phrases, more puzzling than\n",

      "\n",
      "This is an overstatement of a truth, due to Lope's aversion from\n",

      "whose renderings of the two odes _Ibam forte via sacra_ and _Beatus\n",
      "ille_ are among the happiest of versions. Their sobriety of thought\n",
      "is austere, and their classic correctness of diction is in curious\n",

      "perilously near it in this case. Lyly's _Euphues_ was published in\n",
      "1579, while GÃ³ngora was still a student at Salamanca, and Shakespeare\n",
      "died nearly twelve years before a line of GÃ³ngora's later poems was in\n",

      "form of a disease which attacked all Europe. However that may be, there\n",
      "can exist no possible connection between English Euphuism and Spanish\n",
      "Gongorism, save such as comes from a common Italian origin. Gongorism\n",

      "his head whenever he mentions GÃ³ngora's name, and holds the Spaniard\n",
      "up to ridicule by printing a literal translation of his more daring\n",
      "flights. Thus he chooses a passage from the first of the _Soledades_,\n",
      "and asserts that GÃ³ngora sings the praise of \"a maiden so beautiful,\n",
      "that she might parch up Norway with her two suns, and bleach Ethiopia\n",
      "with her two hands.\" Perhaps no poet that ever lived would survive the\n",

      "into epigrams and satires against all and sundry. The court favourites\n",
      "were his special markâLerma, Osuna, Uceda, Rodrigo CalderÃ³n. In 1618\n",

      "he attempts the sacramental play. This kind of drama would almost\n",
      "seem created for the greater glory of CalderÃ³n. The personages\n",
      "of his worldly plays, and even of his _comedias devotas_, tend\n",
      "to become personifications of revenge, love, pride, charity, and\n",
      "the rest. His set pieces are disfigured by want of humour and by\n",
      "over-refinementâfaults which turn to virtues in the _autos_, where\n",
      "abstractions are wedded to the noblest poetry, where the Beyond is\n",
      "brought down to earth, and where doctrinal subtleties are embellished\n",
      "with miraculous ingenuity. To assert that CalderÃ³n is incomparably\n",
      "great in the _autos_ is to imply some censure of his art in his\n",
      "secular dramas. The monotony and artifice of his sacramental plays\n",
      "might be thought inherent to the species, were not these two notes\n",
      "characteristic of his whole theatre. Nor is it an explanation to say\n",
      "that much writing of _autos_ had affected his general methods; for\n",
      "not merely are the secular plays more numerousâthey are also mostly\n",
      "earlier than the _autos_, whose real defects are a lack of dramatic\n",

      "the marrow, but a Spaniard of the seventeenth centuryâa courtier\n",
      "with a turn for _culteranismo_, averse from the picaresque contrasts\n",
      "which lend variety to Lope's scene and to Tirso's. His interpretation\n",
      "of existence is so idealised that his stage becomes in some sort the\n",
      "apotheosis of his century. His characters are not so much men and\n",
      "women, as allegorical types of men and women as CalderÃ³n conceived\n",
      "them. It is not real life that he reveals, for he regarded realism as\n",
      "ignoble and unclean: he offers in its place a brilliant pageant of\n",
      "abstract emotions. He is not a universal dramatist: he ranks with the\n",
      "greatest writers for the Spanish stage, inasmuch as he is the greatest\n",
      "poet using the dramatic form. And, leaving aside his anachronisms and\n",
      "jumblings of mythology, he is a scrupulous artist, careful of his\n",
      "literary form and of his construction. The finished execution of his\n",
      "best passages is so irresistible that FitzGerald declared Isabel's\n",

      "(Old-time Memories). It was his misfortune to be concerned in politics,\n",
      "for which he was unfitted, and to be pinched by continuous poverty,\n",

      "his straitened circumstances; but this is difficult to believe. He\n",

      "three generations of Spaniards, and which seems likely to endure,\n",
      "implies the possession of considerable powers. And Zorrilla had three\n",
      "essential qualities in no common degree: national spirit, dramatic\n",
      "insight, and lyrical spontaneity. He is an inferior Sir Walter, with\n",
      "an added knowledge of the theatre, to which Scott made no pretence.\n",
      "His _Leyenda de Alhamar_, his _Granada_, his _Leyenda del Cid_ were\n",
      "popular for the same reason that _Marmion_ and the _Lady of the Lake_\n",
      "were popular: for their revival of national legends in a form both\n",
      "simple and picturesque. The fate that overcame Sir Walter's poems seems\n",
      "to threaten Zorrilla's. Both are read for the sake of the subject,\n",
      "for the brilliant colouring of episodes, more than for the beauty of\n",

      "wide and lasting that it almost approaches immortality. In the study\n",

      "His manifold interests, the incomparable beauty of his style, his wide\n",
      "reading, his cold lucidity, are an almost ideal equipment for critical\n",
      "work. Expert in ingratiation as he is, his suave complaisance becomes\n",
      "a formidable weapon in such a performance as the _Cartas Americanas_,\n",

      "It is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great town,\n",
      "or travel in the country, when they see the streets, the roads and\n",
      "cabbin-doors crowded with beggars of the female sex, followed by three,\n",
      "four, or six children, all in rags, and importuning every passenger for\n",
      "an alms. These mothers instead of being able to work for their honest\n",
      "livelihood, are forced to employ all their time in stroling to beg\n",
      "sustenance for their helpless infants who, as they grow up, either turn\n",
      "thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country, to fight\n",
      "for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of\n",
      "children in the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their mothers,\n",
      "and frequently of their fathers, is in the present deplorable state of\n",
      "the kingdom, a very great additional grievance; and therefore whoever\n",
      "could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of making these children\n",
      "sound and useful members of the common-wealth, would deserve so well of\n",
      "the publick, as to have his statue set up for a preserver of the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "But my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the\n",
      "children of professed beggars: it is of a much greater extent, and shall\n",
      "take in the whole number of infants at a certain age, who are born of\n",
      "parents in effect as little able to support them, as those who demand\n",
      "our charity in the streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years, upon this\n",
      "important subject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of\n",
      "our projectors, I have always found them grossly mistaken in their\n",
      "computation. It is true, a child just dropt from its dam, may be\n",
      "supported by her milk, for a solar year, with little other nourishment:\n",
      "at most not above the value of two shillings, which the mother may\n",
      "certainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful occupation of\n",
      "begging; and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to provide for\n",
      "them in such a manner, as, instead of being a charge upon their parents,\n",
      "or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest of their lives,\n",
      "they shall, on the contrary, contribute to the feeding, and partly to\n",
      "the cloathing of many thousands.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is likewise another great advantage in my scheme, that it will\n",
      "prevent those voluntary abortions, and that horrid practice of\n",
      "women murdering their bastard children, alas! too frequent among us,\n",
      "sacrificing the poor innocent babes, I doubt, more to avoid the expence\n",
      "than the shame, which would move tears and pity in the most savage and\n",
      "inhuman breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million\n",
      "and a half, of these I calculate there may be about two hundred thousand\n",
      "couple whose wives are breeders; from which number I subtract thirty\n",
      "thousand couple, who are able to maintain their own children, (although\n",
      "I apprehend there cannot be so many, under the present distresses of\n",
      "the kingdom) but this being granted, there will remain an hundred and\n",
      "seventy thousand breeders. I again subtract fifty thousand, for those\n",
      "women who miscarry, or whose children die by accident or disease within\n",
      "the year. There only remain an hundred and twenty thousand children of\n",
      "poor parents annually born. The question therefore is, How this number\n",
      "shall be reared, and provided for? which, as I have already said, under\n",
      "the present situation of affairs, is utterly impossible by all the\n",
      "methods hitherto proposed. For we can neither employ them in handicraft\n",
      "or agriculture; they neither build houses, (I mean in the country) nor\n",
      "cultivate land: they can very seldom pick up a livelihood by stealing\n",
      "till they arrive at six years old; except where they are of towardly\n",
      "parts, although I confess they learn the rudiments much earlier;\n",
      "during which time they can however be properly looked upon only as\n",
      "probationers: As I have been informed by a principal gentleman in the\n",
      "county of Cavan, who protested to me, that he never knew above one or\n",
      "two instances under the age of six, even in a part of the kingdom so\n",
      "renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am assured by our merchants, that a boy or a girl before twelve years\n",
      "old, is no saleable commodity, and even when they come to this age, they\n",
      "will not yield above three pounds, or three pounds and half a crown\n",
      "at most, on the exchange; which cannot turn to account either to the\n",
      "parents or kingdom, the charge of nutriments and rags having been at\n",
      "least four times that value.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will\n",
      "not be liable to the least objection.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in\n",
      "London, that a young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a\n",
      "most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted,\n",
      "baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a\n",
      "fricasie, or a ragoust.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do therefore humbly offer it to publick consideration, that of the\n",
      "hundred and twenty thousand children, already computed, twenty thousand\n",
      "may be reserved for breed, whereof only one fourth part to be males;\n",
      "which is more than we allow to sheep, black cattle, or swine, and my\n",
      "reason is, that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage, a\n",
      "circumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore, one male will\n",
      "be sufficient to serve four females. That the remaining hundred thousand\n",
      "may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the persons of quality and\n",
      "fortune, through the kingdom, always advising the mother to let them\n",
      "suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render them plump, and fat\n",
      "for a good table. A child will make two dishes at an entertainment for\n",
      "friends, and when the family dines alone, the fore or hind quarter will\n",
      "make a reasonable dish, and seasoned with a little pepper or salt, will\n",
      "be very good boiled on the fourth day, especially in winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have reckoned upon a medium, that a child just born will weigh 12\n",
      "pounds, and in a solar year, if tolerably nursed, encreaseth to 28\n",
      "pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "I grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for\n",
      "landlords, who, as they have already devoured most of the parents, seem\n",
      "to have the best title to the children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Infant's flesh will be in season throughout the year, but more plentiful\n",
      "in March, and a little before and after; for we are told by a grave\n",
      "author, an eminent French physician, that fish being a prolifick dyet,\n",
      "there are more children born in Roman Catholick countries about nine\n",
      "months after Lent, the markets will be more glutted than usual, because\n",
      "the number of Popish infants, is at least three to one in this kingdom,\n",
      "and therefore it will have one other collateral advantage, by lessening\n",
      "the number of Papists among us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have already computed the charge of nursing a beggar's child (in which\n",
      "list I reckon all cottagers, labourers, and four-fifths of the farmers)\n",
      "to be about two shillings per annum, rags included; and I believe no\n",
      "gentleman would repine to give ten shillings for the carcass of a good\n",
      "fat child, which, as I have said, will make four dishes of excellent\n",
      "nutritive meat, when he hath only some particular friend, or his\n",
      "own family to dine with him. Thus the squire will learn to be a good\n",
      "landlord, and grow popular among his tenants, the mother will have eight\n",
      "shillings neat profit, and be fit for work till she produces another\n",
      "child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who are more thrifty (as I must confess the times require) may\n",
      "flea the carcass; the skin of which, artificially dressed, will make\n",
      "admirable gloves for ladies, and summer boots for fine gentlemen.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to our City of Dublin, shambles may be appointed for this purpose, in\n",
      "the most convenient parts of it, and butchers we may be assured will not\n",
      "be wanting; although I rather recommend buying the children alive, and\n",
      "dressing them hot from the knife, as we do roasting pigs.\n",
      "\n",
      "A very worthy person, a true lover of his country, and whose virtues\n",
      "I highly esteem, was lately pleased, in discoursing on this matter, to\n",
      "offer a refinement upon my scheme. He said, that many gentlemen of this\n",
      "kingdom, having of late destroyed their deer, he conceived that the\n",
      "want of venison might be well supply'd by the bodies of young lads and\n",
      "maidens, not exceeding fourteen years of age, nor under twelve; so great\n",
      "a number of both sexes in every country being now ready to starve for\n",
      "want of work and service: And these to be disposed of by their parents\n",
      "if alive, or otherwise by their nearest relations. But with due\n",
      "deference to so excellent a friend, and so deserving a patriot, I\n",
      "cannot be altogether in his sentiments; for as to the males, my American\n",
      "acquaintance assured me from frequent experience, that their flesh was\n",
      "generally tough and lean, like that of our school-boys, by continual\n",
      "exercise, and their taste disagreeable, and to fatten them would not\n",
      "answer the charge. Then as to the females, it would, I think, with\n",
      "humble submission, be a loss to the publick, because they soon would\n",
      "become breeders themselves: And besides, it is not improbable that some\n",
      "scrupulous people might be apt to censure such a practice, (although\n",
      "indeed very unjustly) as a little bordering upon cruelty, which, I\n",
      "confess, hath always been with me the strongest objection against any\n",
      "project, how well soever intended.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in order to justify my friend, he confessed, that this expedient\n",
      "was put into his head by the famous Salmanaazor, a native of the island\n",
      "Formosa, who came from thence to London, above twenty years ago, and in\n",
      "conversation told my friend, that in his country, when any young person\n",
      "happened to be put to death, the executioner sold the carcass to persons\n",
      "of quality, as a prime dainty; and that, in his time, the body of a\n",
      "plump girl of fifteen, who was crucified for an attempt to poison the\n",
      "Emperor, was sold to his imperial majesty's prime minister of state, and\n",
      "other great mandarins of the court in joints from the gibbet, at four\n",
      "hundred crowns. Neither indeed can I deny, that if the same use were\n",
      "made of several plump young girls in this town, who without one single\n",
      "groat to their fortunes, cannot stir abroad without a chair, and appear\n",
      "at a play-house and assemblies in foreign fineries which they never will\n",
      "pay for; the kingdom would not be the worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that vast\n",
      "number of poor people, who are aged, diseased, or maimed; and I have\n",
      "been desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken, to ease\n",
      "the nation of so grievous an incumbrance. But I am not in the least pain\n",
      "upon that matter, because it is very well known, that they are every day\n",
      "dying, and rotting, by cold and famine, and filth, and vermin, as fast\n",
      "as can be reasonably expected. And as to the young labourers, they\n",
      "are now in almost as hopeful a condition. They cannot get work, and\n",
      "consequently pine away from want of nourishment, to a degree, that if\n",
      "at any time they are accidentally hired to common labour, they have not\n",
      "strength to perform it, and thus the country and themselves are happily\n",
      "delivered from the evils to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have too long digressed, and therefore shall return to my subject. I\n",
      "think the advantages by the proposal which I have made are obvious and\n",
      "many, as well as of the highest importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "For first, as I have already observed, it would greatly lessen the\n",
      "number of Papists, with whom we are yearly over-run, being the principal\n",
      "breeders of the nation, as well as our most dangerous enemies, and who\n",
      "stay at home on purpose with a design to deliver the kingdom to the\n",
      "Pretender, hoping to take their advantage by the absence of so many good\n",
      "Protestants, who have chosen rather to leave their country, than stay at\n",
      "home and pay tithes against their conscience to an episcopal curate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, The poorer tenants will have something valuable of their own,\n",
      "which by law may be made liable to a distress, and help to pay their\n",
      "landlord's rent, their corn and cattle being already seized, and money a\n",
      "thing unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, Whereas the maintainance of an hundred thousand children,\n",
      "from two years old, and upwards, cannot be computed at less than\n",
      "ten shillings a piece per annum, the nation's stock will be thereby\n",
      "encreased fifty thousand pounds per annum, besides the profit of a\n",
      "new dish, introduced to the tables of all gentlemen of fortune in the\n",
      "kingdom, who have any refinement in taste. And the money will circulate\n",
      "among our selves, the goods being entirely of our own growth and\n",
      "manufacture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourthly, The constant breeders, besides the gain of eight shillings\n",
      "sterling per annum by the sale of their children, will be rid of the\n",
      "charge of maintaining them after the first year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifthly, This food would likewise bring great custom to taverns,\n",
      "where the vintners will certainly be so prudent as to procure the best\n",
      "receipts for dressing it to perfection; and consequently have their\n",
      "houses frequented by all the fine gentlemen, who justly value themselves\n",
      "upon their knowledge in good eating; and a skilful cook, who understands\n",
      "how to oblige his guests, will contrive to make it as expensive as they\n",
      "please.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sixthly, This would be a great inducement to marriage, which all wise\n",
      "nations have either encouraged by rewards, or enforced by laws and\n",
      "penalties. It would encrease the care and tenderness of mothers towards\n",
      "their children, when they were sure of a settlement for life to the\n",
      "poor babes, provided in some sort by the publick, to their annual profit\n",
      "instead of expence. We should soon see an honest emulation among the\n",
      "married women, which of them could bring the fattest child to the\n",
      "market. Men would become as fond of their wives, during the time of\n",
      "their pregnancy, as they are now of their mares in foal, their cows in\n",
      "calf, or sow when they are ready to farrow; nor offer to beat or kick\n",
      "them (as is too frequent a practice) for fear of a miscarriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many other advantages might be enumerated. For instance, the addition\n",
      "of some thousand carcasses in our exportation of barrel'd beef: the\n",
      "propagation of swine's flesh, and improvement in the art of making good\n",
      "bacon, so much wanted among us by the great destruction of pigs,\n",
      "too frequent at our tables; which are no way comparable in taste or\n",
      "magnificence to a well grown, fat yearly child, which roasted whole will\n",
      "make a considerable figure at a Lord Mayor's feast, or any other publick\n",
      "entertainment. But this, and many others, I omit, being studious of\n",
      "brevity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Supposing that one thousand families in this city, would be constant\n",
      "customers for infants flesh, besides others who might have it at merry\n",
      "meetings, particularly at weddings and christenings, I compute that\n",
      "Dublin would take off annually about twenty thousand carcasses; and the\n",
      "rest of the kingdom (where probably they will be sold somewhat cheaper)\n",
      "the remaining eighty thousand.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can think of no one objection, that will possibly be raised against\n",
      "this proposal, unless it should be urged, that the number of people will\n",
      "be thereby much lessened in the kingdom. This I freely own, and 'twas\n",
      "indeed one principal design in offering it to the world. I desire the\n",
      "reader will observe, that I calculate my remedy for this one individual\n",
      "Kingdom of Ireland, and for no other that ever was, is, or, I think,\n",
      "ever can be upon Earth. Therefore let no man talk to me of other\n",
      "expedients: Of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound: Of using\n",
      "neither cloaths, nor houshold furniture, except what is of our\n",
      "own growth and manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the materials and\n",
      "instruments that promote foreign luxury: Of curing the expensiveness of\n",
      "pride, vanity, idleness, and gaming in our women: Of introducing a vein\n",
      "of parsimony, prudence and temperance: Of learning to love our\n",
      "country, wherein we differ even from Laplanders, and the inhabitants\n",
      "of Topinamboo: Of quitting our animosities and factions, nor acting any\n",
      "longer like the Jews, who were murdering one another at the very moment\n",
      "their city was taken: Of being a little cautious not to sell our country\n",
      "and consciences for nothing: Of teaching landlords to have at least one\n",
      "degree of mercy towards their tenants. Lastly, of putting a spirit of\n",
      "honesty, industry, and skill into our shop-keepers, who, if a resolution\n",
      "could now be taken to buy only our native goods, would immediately unite\n",
      "to cheat and exact upon us in the price, the measure, and the goodness,\n",
      "nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair proposal of just dealing,\n",
      "though often and earnestly invited to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like\n",
      "expedients, 'till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will\n",
      "ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice.\n",
      "\n",

      "MARLEY was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt\n",
      "whatever about that. The register of his burial was\n",
      "signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,\n",
      "and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and\n",
      "Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he\n",
      "chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a\n",
      "door-nail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my\n",
      "own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about\n",
      "a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to\n",
      "regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery\n",
      "in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors\n",
      "is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands\n",
      "shall not disturb it, or the Country's done for. You\n",
      "will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that\n",
      "Marley was as dead as a door-nail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did.\n",
      "How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were\n",
      "partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge\n",
      "was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole\n",
      "assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and\n",
      "sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully\n",
      "cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent\n",
      "man of business on the very day of the funeral,\n",
      "and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to\n",
      "the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley\n",
      "was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or\n",
      "nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going\n",
      "to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that\n",
      "Hamlet's Father died before the play began, there\n",
      "would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a\n",
      "stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\n",
      "than there would be in any other middle-aged\n",
      "gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy\n",
      "spot--say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance--\n",
      "literally to astonish his son's weak mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name.\n",
      "There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse\n",
      "door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as\n",
      "Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the\n",
      "business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley,\n",
      "but he answered to both names. It was all the\n",
      "same to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone,\n",
      "Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping,\n",
      "clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint,\n",
      "from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire;\n",
      "secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The\n",
      "cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed\n",
      "nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his\n",
      "eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his\n",
      "grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his\n",
      "eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low\n",
      "temperature always about with him; he iced his office in\n",
      "the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n",
      "\n",
      "External heat and cold had little influence on\n",
      "Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather\n",
      "chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he,\n",
      "no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no\n",
      "pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't\n",
      "know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and\n",
      "snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage\n",
      "over him in only one respect. They often \"came down\"\n",
      "handsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with\n",
      "gladsome looks, \"My dear Scrooge, how are you?\n",
      "When will you come to see me?\" No beggars implored\n",
      "him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him\n",
      "what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all\n",
      "his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of\n",
      "Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to\n",
      "know him; and when they saw him coming on, would\n",
      "tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and\n",
      "then would wag their tails as though they said, \"No\n",
      "eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing\n",
      "he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths\n",
      "of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance,\n",
      "was what the knowing ones call \"nuts\" to Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year,\n",
      "on Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his\n",
      "counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy\n",
      "withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside,\n",
      "go wheezing up and down, beating their hands\n",
      "upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the\n",
      "pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had\n",
      "only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--\n",
      "it had not been light all day--and candles were flaring\n",
      "in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like\n",
      "ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog\n",
      "came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was\n",
      "so dense without, that although the court was of the\n",
      "narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms.\n",
      "To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring\n",
      "everything, one might have thought that Nature\n",
      "lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open\n",
      "that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a\n",
      "dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying\n",
      "letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's\n",
      "fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one\n",
      "coal. But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept\n",
      "the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the\n",
      "clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted\n",
      "that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore\n",
      "the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to\n",
      "warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being\n",
      "a man of a strong imagination, he failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\" cried\n",
      "a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge's\n",
      "nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was\n",
      "the first intimation he had of his approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bah!\" said Scrooge, \"Humbug!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the\n",
      "fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's, that he was\n",
      "all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his\n",
      "eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Christmas a humbug, uncle!\" said Scrooge's\n",
      "nephew. \"You don't mean that, I am sure?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"Merry Christmas! What\n",
      "right have you to be merry? What reason have you\n",
      "to be merry? You're poor enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, then,\" returned the nephew gaily. \"What\n",
      "right have you to be dismal? What reason have you\n",
      "to be morose? You're rich enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur\n",
      "of the moment, said, \"Bah!\" again; and followed it up\n",
      "with \"Humbug.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be cross, uncle!\" said the nephew.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What else can I be,\" returned the uncle, \"when I\n",
      "live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas!\n",
      "Out upon merry Christmas! What's Christmas\n",
      "time to you but a time for paying bills without\n",
      "money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but\n",
      "not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books\n",
      "and having every item in 'em through a round dozen\n",
      "of months presented dead against you? If I could\n",
      "work my will,\" said Scrooge indignantly, \"every idiot\n",
      "who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips,\n",
      "should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried\n",
      "with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Uncle!\" pleaded the nephew.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nephew!\" returned the uncle sternly, \"keep Christmas\n",
      "in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Keep it!\" repeated Scrooge's nephew. \"But you\n",
      "don't keep it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me leave it alone, then,\" said Scrooge. \"Much\n",
      "good may it do you! Much good it has ever done\n",
      "you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are many things from which I might have\n",
      "derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare\n",
      "say,\" returned the nephew. \"Christmas among the\n",
      "rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas\n",
      "time, when it has come round--apart from the\n",
      "veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything\n",
      "belonging to it can be apart from that--as a\n",
      "good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant\n",
      "time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar\n",
      "of the year, when men and women seem by one consent\n",
      "to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think\n",
      "of people below them as if they really were\n",
      "fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race\n",
      "of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\n",
      "uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or\n",
      "silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me\n",
      "good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded.\n",
      "Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety,\n",
      "he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark\n",
      "for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me hear another sound from you,\" said\n",
      "Scrooge, \"and you'll keep your Christmas by losing\n",
      "your situation! You're quite a powerful speaker,\n",
      "sir,\" he added, turning to his nephew. \"I wonder you\n",
      "don't go into Parliament.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge said that he would see him--yes, indeed he\n",
      "did. He went the whole length of the expression,\n",
      "and said that he would see him in that extremity first.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why?\" cried Scrooge's nephew. \"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why did you get married?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because I fell in love.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because you fell in love!\" growled Scrooge, as if\n",
      "that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous\n",
      "than a merry Christmas. \"Good afternoon!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before\n",
      "that happened. Why give it as a reason for not\n",
      "coming now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you;\n",
      "why cannot we be friends?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so\n",
      "resolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I\n",
      "have been a party. But I have made the trial in\n",
      "homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas\n",
      "humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And A Happy New Year!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "His nephew left the room without an angry word,\n",
      "notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to\n",
      "bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who,\n",
      "cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\n",
      "them cordially.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's another fellow,\" muttered Scrooge; who\n",
      "overheard him: \"my clerk, with fifteen shillings a\n",
      "week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry\n",
      "Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had\n",
      "let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen,\n",
      "pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off,\n",
      "in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in\n",
      "their hands, and bowed to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,\" said one of the\n",
      "gentlemen, referring to his list. \"Have I the pleasure\n",
      "of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\"\n",
      "Scrooge replied. \"He died seven years ago, this very\n",
      "night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have no doubt his liberality is well represented\n",
      "by his surviving partner,\" said the gentleman, presenting\n",
      "his credentials.\n",
      "\n",
      "It certainly was; for they had been two kindred\n",
      "spirits. At the ominous word \"liberality,\" Scrooge\n",
      "frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials\n",
      "back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\"\n",
      "said the gentleman, taking up a pen, \"it is more than\n",
      "usually desirable that we should make some slight\n",
      "provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer\n",
      "greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in\n",
      "want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands\n",
      "are in want of common comforts, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are there no prisons?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Plenty of prisons,\" said the gentleman, laying down\n",
      "the pen again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the Union workhouses?\" demanded Scrooge.\n",
      "\"Are they still in operation?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are. Still,\" returned the gentleman, \"I wish\n",
      "I could say they were not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour,\n",
      "then?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Both very busy, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first,\n",
      "that something had occurred to stop them in their\n",
      "useful course,\" said Scrooge. \"I'm very glad to\n",
      "hear it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Under the impression that they scarcely furnish\n",
      "Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,\"\n",
      "returned the gentleman, \"a few of us are endeavouring\n",
      "to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink,\n",
      "and means of warmth. We choose this time, because\n",
      "it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt,\n",
      "and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down\n",
      "for?\"\n",

      "\"Nothing!\" Scrooge replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You wish to be anonymous?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish to be left alone,\" said Scrooge. \"Since you\n",
      "ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer.\n",
      "I don't make merry myself at Christmas and I can't\n",
      "afford to make idle people merry. I help to support\n",
      "the establishments I have mentioned--they cost\n",
      "enough; and those who are badly off must go there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Many can't go there; and many would rather die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If they would rather die,\" said Scrooge, \"they had\n",
      "better do it, and decrease the surplus population.\n",
      "Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you might know it,\" observed the gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not my business,\" Scrooge returned. \"It's\n",
      "enough for a man to understand his own business, and\n",
      "not to interfere with other people's. Mine occupies\n",
      "me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue\n",
      "their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed\n",
      "his labours with an improved opinion of himself,\n",
      "and in a more facetious temper than was usual\n",
      "with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that\n",
      "people ran about with flaring links, proffering their\n",
      "services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct\n",
      "them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\n",
      "whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down\n",
      "at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became\n",
      "invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the\n",
      "clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if\n",
      "its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there.\n",
      "The cold became intense. In the main street, at the\n",
      "corner of the court, some labourers were repairing\n",
      "the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\n",
      "round which a party of ragged men and boys were\n",
      "gathered: warming their hands and winking their\n",
      "eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\n",
      "being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed,\n",
      "and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness\n",
      "of the shops where holly sprigs and berries\n",
      "crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale\n",
      "faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers'\n",
      "trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant,\n",
      "with which it was next to impossible to believe that\n",
      "such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything\n",
      "to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the\n",
      "mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks\n",
      "and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's\n",
      "household should; and even the little tailor, whom he\n",
      "had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for\n",
      "being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up\n",
      "to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean\n",
      "wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting\n",
      "cold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped\n",
      "the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such weather\n",
      "as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then\n",
      "indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The\n",
      "owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled\n",
      "by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\n",
      "stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with\n",
      "a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"God bless you, merry gentleman!\n",
      "         May nothing you dismay!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action,\n",
      "that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to\n",
      "the fog and even more congenial frost.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house\n",
      "arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his\n",
      "stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant\n",
      "clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out,\n",
      "and put on his hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\" said\n",
      "Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If quite convenient, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not convenient,\" said Scrooge, \"and it's not\n",
      "fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you'd\n",
      "think yourself ill-used, I'll be bound?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The clerk smiled faintly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yet,\" said Scrooge, \"you don't think me ill-used,\n",
      "when I pay a day's wages for no work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every\n",
      "twenty-fifth of December!\" said Scrooge, buttoning\n",
      "his great-coat to the chin. \"But I suppose you must\n",
      "have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\n",
      "morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge\n",
      "walked out with a growl. The office was closed in a\n",
      "twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his\n",
      "white comforter dangling below his waist (for he\n",
      "boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill,\n",
      "at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in\n",
      "honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home\n",
      "to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play\n",
      "at blindman's-buff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual\n",
      "melancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and\n",
      "beguiled the rest of the evening with his\n",
      "banker's-book, went home to bed. He lived in\n",
      "chambers which had once belonged to his deceased\n",
      "partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a\n",
      "lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so\n",
      "little business to be, that one could scarcely help\n",
      "fancying it must have run there when it was a young\n",
      "house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses,\n",
      "and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough\n",
      "now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but\n",
      "Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.\n",
      "The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew\n",
      "its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands.\n",
      "The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway\n",
      "of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of\n",
      "the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\n",
      "threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all\n",
      "particular about the knocker on the door, except that it\n",
      "was very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had\n",
      "seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\n",
      "in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what\n",
      "is called fancy about him as any man in the city of\n",
      "London, even including--which is a bold word--the\n",
      "corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be\n",
      "borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one\n",
      "thought on Marley, since his last mention of his\n",
      "seven years' dead partner that afternoon. And then\n",
      "let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened\n",
      "that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door,\n",
      "saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate\n",
      "process of change--not a knocker, but Marley's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow\n",
      "as the other objects in the yard were, but had a\n",
      "dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark\n",
      "cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked\n",
      "at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly\n",
      "spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The\n",
      "hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\n",
      "and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly\n",
      "motionless. That, and its livid colour, made it\n",
      "horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the\n",
      "face and beyond its control, rather than a part of\n",
      "its own expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it\n",
      "was a knocker again.\n",
      "\n",
      "To say that he was not startled, or that his blood\n",
      "was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it\n",
      "had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue.\n",
      "But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished,\n",
      "turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did pause, with a moment's irresolution, before\n",
      "he shut the door; and he did look cautiously behind\n",
      "it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the\n",
      "sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the hall.\n",
      "But there was nothing on the back of the door, except\n",
      "the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he\n",
      "said \"Pooh, pooh!\" and closed it with a bang.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound resounded through the house like thunder.\n",
      "Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant's\n",
      "cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal\n",
      "of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to\n",
      "be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and\n",
      "walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too:\n",
      "trimming his candle as he went.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six\n",
      "up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad\n",
      "young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you\n",
      "might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken\n",
      "it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall\n",
      "and the door towards the balustrades: and done it\n",
      "easy. There was plenty of width for that, and room\n",
      "to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge\n",
      "thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before\n",
      "him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of\n",
      "the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well,\n",
      "so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with\n",
      "Scrooge's dip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that.\n",
      "Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But before\n",
      "he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms\n",
      "to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection\n",
      "of the face to desire to do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they\n",
      "should be. Nobody under the table, nobody under\n",
      "the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin\n",
      "ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had\n",
      "a cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under the\n",
      "bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown,\n",
      "which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\n",
      "against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard,\n",
      "old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three\n",
      "legs, and a poker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked\n",
      "himself in; double-locked himself in, which was not his\n",
      "custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off\n",
      "his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and\n",
      "his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take\n",
      "his gruel.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a\n",
      "bitter night. He was obliged to sit close to it, and\n",
      "brood over it, before he could extract the least\n",
      "sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel.\n",
      "The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch\n",
      "merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint\n",
      "Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.\n",
      "There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters;\n",
      "Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending\n",
      "through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams,\n",
      "Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats,\n",
      "hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts;\n",
      "and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came\n",
      "like the ancient Prophet's rod, and swallowed up the\n",
      "whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at first,\n",
      "with power to shape some picture on its surface from\n",
      "the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would\n",
      "have been a copy of old Marley's head on every one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Humbug!\" said Scrooge; and walked across the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "After several turns, he sat down again. As he\n",
      "threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened\n",
      "to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the\n",
      "room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten\n",
      "with a chamber in the highest story of the\n",
      "building. It was with great astonishment, and with\n",
      "a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he\n",
      "saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in\n",
      "the outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it\n",
      "rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute,\n",
      "but it seemed an hour. The bells ceased as they had\n",
      "begun, together. They were succeeded by a clanking\n",
      "noise, deep down below; as if some person were\n",
      "dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the\n",
      "wine-merchant's cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have\n",
      "heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as\n",
      "dragging chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound,\n",
      "and then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors\n",
      "below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight\n",
      "towards his door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's humbug still!\" said Scrooge. \"I won't believe it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His colour changed though, when, without a pause,\n",
      "it came on through the heavy door, and passed into\n",
      "the room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the\n",
      "dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, \"I know\n",
      "him; Marley's Ghost!\" and fell again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail,\n",
      "usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on\n",
      "the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts,\n",
      "and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was\n",
      "clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound\n",
      "about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge\n",
      "observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks,\n",
      "ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel.\n",
      "His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him,\n",
      "and looking through his waistcoat, could see\n",
      "the two buttons on his coat behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no\n",
      "bowels, but he had never believed it until now.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he\n",
      "looked the phantom through and through, and saw\n",
      "it standing before him; though he felt the chilling\n",
      "influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very\n",
      "texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head\n",
      "and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before;\n",
      "he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How now!\" said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever.\n",
      "\"What do you want with me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Much!\"--Marley's voice, no doubt about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who are you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ask me who I was.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who were you then?\" said Scrooge, raising his\n",
      "voice. \"You're particular, for a shade.\" He was going\n",
      "to say \"to a shade,\" but substituted this, as more\n",
      "appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you--can you sit down?\" asked Scrooge, looking\n",
      "doubtfully at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do it, then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge asked the question, because he didn't know\n",
      "whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in\n",
      "a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event\n",
      "of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity\n",
      "of an embarrassing explanation. But the ghost sat\n",
      "down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he\n",
      "were quite used to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't believe in me,\" observed the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of\n",
      "your senses?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you doubt your senses?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because,\" said Scrooge, \"a little thing affects them.\n",
      "A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may\n",
      "be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of\n",
      "cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There's more of\n",
      "gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking\n",
      "jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means\n",
      "waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be\n",
      "smart, as a means of distracting his own attention,\n",
      "and keeping down his terror; for the spectre's voice\n",
      "disturbed the very marrow in his bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "To sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence\n",
      "for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very\n",
      "deuce with him. There was something very awful,\n",
      "too, in the spectre's being provided with an infernal\n",
      "atmosphere of its own. Scrooge could not feel it\n",
      "himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the\n",
      "Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts,\n",
      "and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour\n",
      "from an oven.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see this toothpick?\" said Scrooge, returning\n",
      "quickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned;\n",
      "and wishing, though it were only for a second, to\n",
      "divert the vision's stony gaze from himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do,\" replied the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are not looking at it,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I see it,\" said the Ghost, \"notwithstanding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well!\" returned Scrooge, \"I have but to swallow\n",
      "this, and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a\n",
      "legion of goblins, all of my own creation. Humbug,\n",
      "I tell you! humbug!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook\n",
      "its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that\n",
      "Scrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself\n",
      "from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was\n",
      "his horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage\n",
      "round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors,\n",
      "its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands\n",
      "before his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mercy!\" he said. \"Dreadful apparition, why do\n",
      "you trouble me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Man of the worldly mind!\" replied the Ghost, \"do\n",
      "you believe in me or not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"I must. But why do spirits\n",
      "walk the earth, and why do they come to me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is required of every man,\" the Ghost returned,\n",
      "\"that the spirit within him should walk abroad among\n",
      "his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that\n",

      "\"I have none to give,\" the Ghost replied. \"It comes\n",
      "from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed\n",
      "by other ministers, to other kinds of men. Nor\n",
      "can I tell you what I would. A very little more is\n",

      "again. \"Mankind was my business. The common\n",
      "welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance,\n",
      "and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings\n",

      "\n",
      "It held up its chain at arm's length, as if that were\n",

      "heavily upon the ground again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At this time of the rolling year,\" the spectre said,\n",
      "\"I suffer most. Why did I walk through crowds of\n",

      "\n",

      "and wiped the perspiration from his brow.\n",

      "\"That is no light part of my penance,\" pursued\n",
      "the Ghost. \"I am here to-night to warn you, that you\n",

      "Ghost's had done.\n",

      "\n",
      "When it had said these words, the spectre took its\n",
      "wrapper from the table, and bound it round its head,\n",
      "as before. Scrooge knew this, by the smart sound its\n",
      "teeth made, when the jaws were brought together\n",
      "by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again,\n",
      "and found his supernatural visitor confronting him\n",

      "The apparition walked backward from him; and at\n",
      "every step it took, the window raised itself a little,\n",

      "It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did.\n",
      "When they were within two paces of each other,\n",

      "come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear:\n",
      "for on the raising of the hand, he became sensible\n",
      "of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of\n",
      "lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and\n",
      "self-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment,\n",
      "joined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the\n",
      "bleak, dark night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge followed to the window: desperate in his\n",
      "curiosity. He looked out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither\n",
      "and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they\n",
      "went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley's\n",
      "Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments)\n",
      "were linked together; none were free. Many had\n",
      "been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He\n",
      "had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white\n",
      "waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to\n",
      "its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist\n",
      "a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below,\n",
      "upon a door-step. The misery with them all was,\n",
      "clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in\n",
      "human matters, and had lost the power for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist\n",
      "enshrouded them, he could not tell. But they and\n",

      "as it had been when he walked home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door\n",
      "by which the Ghost had entered. It was double-locked,\n",
      "as he had locked it with his own hands, and\n",
      "the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say \"Humbug!\"\n",
      "but stopped at the first syllable. And being,\n",
      "from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues\n",
      "of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or\n",
      "the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of\n",
      "the hour, much in need of repose; went straight to\n",

      "instant.\n",

      "\n",
      "STAVE II:  THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS\n",
      "\n",
      "WHEN Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that looking out of bed,\n",
      "he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from\n",
      "the opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to\n",
      "pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a\n",
      "neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened\n",
      "for the hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "To his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from\n",
      "six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to\n",
      "twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he\n",
      "went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have\n",
      "got into the works. Twelve!\n",
      "\n",
      "He touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most\n",
      "preposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve:\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why, it isn't possible,\" said Scrooge, \"that I can have\n",

      "isn't possible that anything has happened to the sun, and\n",
      "this is twelve at noon!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed,\n",
      "and groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub\n",
      "the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he\n",
      "could see anything; and could see very little then. All he\n",
      "could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely\n",
      "cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro,\n",
      "and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been\n",
      "if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the\n",
      "world.  This was a great relief, because \"three days after sight\n",
      "of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his\n",
      "order,\" and so forth, would have become a mere United States'\n",
      "security if there were no days to count by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought\n",
      "it over and over and over, and could make nothing of it.  The more he\n",
      "thought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured\n",
      "not to think, the more he thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved\n",
      "within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his\n",
      "mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first\n",
      "position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through,\n",
      "\"Was it a dream or not?\"\n",

      "Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters\n",
      "more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned\n",
      "him of a visitation when the bell tolled one.  He resolved to lie\n",
      "awake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could\n",
      "no more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the\n",
      "wisest resolution in his power.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he\n",

      "\"The hour itself,\" said Scrooge, triumphantly, \"and nothing else!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a\n",
      "deep, dull, hollow, melancholy ONE.  Light flashed up in the room\n",
      "upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a\n",
      "hand. Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his\n",
      "back, but those to which his face was addressed. The curtains\n",
      "of his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a\n",
      "half-recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the\n",
      "unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now\n",
      "to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a strange figure--like a child: yet not so like a\n",
      "child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural\n",
      "medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded\n",
      "from the view, and being diminished to a child's proportions.\n",
      "Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was\n",
      "white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in\n",
      "it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were\n",
      "very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold\n",
      "were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately\n",
      "formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic\n",
      "of the purest white; and round its waist was bound\n",
      "a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held\n",
      "a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular\n",
      "contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed\n",
      "with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was,\n",
      "that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear\n",
      "jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was\n",
      "doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a\n",
      "great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing\n",
      "steadiness, was not its strangest quality. For as its belt\n",
      "sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another,\n",
      "and what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so\n",
      "the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a\n",
      "thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs,\n",
      "now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a\n",
      "body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible\n",
      "in the dense gloom wherein they melted away. And in the\n",
      "very wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and\n",
      "clear as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to\n",
      "me?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if\n",
      "instead of being so close beside him, it were at a distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who, and what are you?\" Scrooge demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.\"\n",

      "stature.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. Your past.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps, Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if\n",
      "anybody could have asked him; but he had a special desire\n",
      "to see the Spirit in his cap; and begged him to be covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\" exclaimed the Ghost, \"would you so soon put out,\n",
      "with worldly hands, the light I give? Is it not enough\n",
      "that you are one of those whose passions made this cap, and\n",
      "force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon\n",
      "my brow!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend\n",
      "or any knowledge of having wilfully \"bonneted\" the Spirit at\n",
      "any period of his life. He then made bold to inquire what\n",
      "business brought him there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your welfare!\" said the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not\n",
      "help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been\n",
      "more conducive to that end. The Spirit must have heard\n",
      "him thinking, for it said immediately:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your reclamation, then. Take heed!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him\n",
      "gently by the arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rise! and walk with me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the\n",
      "weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes;\n",
      "that bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below\n",
      "freezing; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers,\n",
      "dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at\n",
      "that time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman's hand,\n",
      "was not to be resisted. He rose: but finding that the Spirit\n",
      "made towards the window, clasped his robe in supplication.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am a mortal,\" Scrooge remonstrated, \"and liable to fall.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bear but a touch of my hand there,\" said the Spirit,\n",
      "laying it upon his heart, \"and you shall be upheld in more\n",
      "than this!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall,\n",
      "and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either\n",
      "hand. The city had entirely vanished. Not a vestige of it\n",
      "was to be seen. The darkness and the mist had vanished\n",
      "with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon\n",
      "the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good Heaven!\" said Scrooge, clasping his hands together,\n",
      "as he looked about him. \"I was bred in this place. I was\n",
      "a boy here!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch,\n",
      "though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still\n",
      "present to the old man's sense of feeling. He was conscious\n",
      "of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected\n",
      "with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares\n",
      "long, long, forgotten!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your lip is trembling,\" said the Ghost. \"And what is\n",
      "that upon your cheek?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice,\n",
      "that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him\n",

      "\"You recollect the way?\" inquired the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Remember it!\" cried Scrooge with fervour; \"I could\n",
      "walk it blindfold.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!\" observed\n",
      "the Ghost. \"Let us go on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every\n",
      "gate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared\n",
      "in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river.\n",
      "Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them\n",
      "with boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in\n",
      "country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys\n",
      "were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the\n",
      "broad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air\n",
      "laughed to hear it!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These are but shadows of the things that have been,\" said\n",
      "the Ghost. \"They have no consciousness of us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge\n",
      "knew and named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond\n",
      "all bounds to see them! Why did his cold eye glisten, and\n",
      "his heart leap up as they went past! Why was he filled\n",
      "with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry\n",
      "Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for\n",
      "their several homes! What was merry Christmas to Scrooge?\n",
      "Out upon merry Christmas! What good had it ever done\n",
      "to him?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The school is not quite deserted,\" said the Ghost. \"A\n",
      "solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "They left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and\n",
      "soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little\n",
      "weathercock-surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell\n",
      "hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of broken\n",
      "fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls\n",
      "were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their\n",
      "gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables;\n",
      "and the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass.\n",
      "Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for\n",
      "entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open\n",
      "doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished,\n",
      "cold, and vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a\n",
      "chilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow\n",
      "with too much getting up by candle-light, and not too\n",
      "much to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a\n",
      "door at the back of the house. It opened before them, and\n",
      "disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by\n",
      "lines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of these a lonely\n",
      "boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down\n",
      "upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he\n",
      "used to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle\n",
      "from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the\n",
      "half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among\n",
      "the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle\n",
      "swinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in\n",
      "the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening\n",
      "influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his\n",
      "younger self, intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man, in\n",
      "foreign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at:\n",
      "stood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his belt, and\n",
      "leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it's Ali Baba!\" Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. \"It's\n",
      "dear old honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know! One Christmas\n",
      "time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone,\n",
      "he did come, for the first time, just like that. Poor boy! And\n",
      "Valentine,\" said Scrooge, \"and his wild brother, Orson; there\n",
      "they go! And what's his name, who was put down in his\n",
      "drawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don't you see him!\n",
      "And the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the Genii;\n",
      "there he is upon his head! Serve him right. I'm glad of it.\n",
      "What business had he to be married to the Princess!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature\n",
      "on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between\n",
      "laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited\n",
      "face; would have been a surprise to his business friends in\n",
      "the city, indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's the Parrot!\" cried Scrooge. \"Green body and\n",
      "yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the\n",
      "top of his head; there he is! Poor Robin Crusoe, he called\n",
      "him, when he came home again after sailing round the\n",
      "island. 'Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin\n",
      "Crusoe?'  The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't.\n",
      "It was the Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running\n",
      "for his life to the little creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his\n",
      "usual character, he said, in pity for his former self, \"Poor\n",
      "boy!\" and cried again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish,\" Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his\n",
      "pocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with his\n",
      "cuff: \"but it's too late now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the matter?\" asked the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" said Scrooge. \"Nothing. There was a boy\n",
      "singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should\n",
      "like to have given him something: that's all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand:\n",
      "saying as it did so, \"Let us see another Christmas!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the\n",
      "room became a little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk,\n",
      "the windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the\n",
      "ceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how\n",
      "all this was brought about, Scrooge knew no more than you\n",
      "do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything\n",
      "had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all\n",
      "the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly.\n",
      "Scrooge looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of\n",
      "his head, glanced anxiously towards the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "It opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy,\n",
      "came darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and\n",
      "often kissing him, addressed him as her \"Dear, dear\n",
      "brother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have come to bring you home, dear brother!\" said the\n",
      "child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh.\n",
      "\"To bring you home, home, home!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Home, little Fan?\" returned the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes!\" said the child, brimful of glee. \"Home, for good\n",
      "and all. Home, for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder\n",
      "than he used to be, that home's like Heaven! He spoke so\n",
      "gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that\n",
      "I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come\n",
      "home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach\n",
      "to bring you. And you're to be a man!\" said the child,\n",
      "opening her eyes, \"and are never to come back here; but\n",
      "first, we're to be together all the Christmas long, and have\n",
      "the merriest time in all the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are quite a woman, little Fan!\" exclaimed the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his\n",
      "head; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on\n",
      "tiptoe to embrace him. Then she began to drag him, in her\n",
      "childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to\n",
      "go, accompanied her.\n",
      "\n",
      "A terrible voice in the hall cried, \"Bring down Master\n",
      "Scrooge's box, there!\" and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster\n",
      "himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious\n",
      "condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind\n",
      "by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him and his\n",
      "sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best-parlour that\n",
      "ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial\n",
      "and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold.\n",
      "Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a\n",
      "block of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments\n",
      "of those dainties to the young people: at the same time,\n",
      "sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of \"something\"\n",
      "to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman,\n",
      "but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had\n",
      "rather not. Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied\n",
      "on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster\n",
      "good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove\n",
      "gaily down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the\n",
      "hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens\n",
      "like spray.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have\n",
      "withered,\" said the Ghost. \"But she had a large heart!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So she had,\" cried Scrooge. \"You're right. I will not\n",
      "gainsay it, Spirit. God forbid!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She died a woman,\" said the Ghost, \"and had, as I think,\n",
      "children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One child,\" Scrooge returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True,\" said the Ghost. \"Your nephew!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly,\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Although they had but that moment left the school behind\n",
      "them, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city,\n",
      "where shadowy passengers passed and repassed; where shadowy\n",
      "carts and coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and\n",
      "tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough, by\n",
      "the dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas\n",
      "time again; but it was evening, and the streets were\n",
      "lighted up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked\n",
      "Scrooge if he knew it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Know it!\" said Scrooge. \"Was I apprenticed here!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh\n",
      "wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two\n",
      "inches taller he must have knocked his head against the\n",
      "ceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it's Fezziwig\n",
      "alive again!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the\n",
      "clock, which pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his\n",
      "hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over\n",
      "himself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and\n",
      "called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly\n",
      "in, accompanied by his fellow-'prentice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dick Wilkins, to be sure!\" said Scrooge to the Ghost.\n",
      "\"Bless me, yes. There he is. He was very much attached\n",
      "to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear, dear!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yo ho, my boys!\" said Fezziwig. \"No more work to-night.\n",
      "Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let's\n",
      "have the shutters up,\" cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap\n",
      "of his hands, \"before a man can say Jack Robinson!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it!\n",
      "They charged into the street with the shutters--one, two,\n",
      "three--had 'em up in their places--four, five, six--barred\n",
      "'em and pinned 'em--seven, eight, nine--and came back\n",
      "before you could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hilli-ho!\" cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the\n",
      "high desk, with wonderful agility. \"Clear away, my lads,\n",
      "and let's have lots of room here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup,\n",
      "Ebenezer!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Clear away! There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared\n",
      "away, or couldn't have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking\n",
      "on. It was done in a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if\n",
      "it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was\n",
      "swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon\n",
      "the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and\n",
      "bright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon a winter's\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the\n",
      "lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty\n",
      "stomach-aches. In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial\n",
      "smile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and\n",
      "lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they\n",
      "broke. In came all the young men and women employed in\n",
      "the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the\n",
      "baker. In came the cook, with her brother's particular friend,\n",
      "the milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was\n",
      "suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying\n",
      "to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who\n",
      "was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress.\n",
      "In they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly,\n",
      "some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling;\n",
      "in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went,\n",
      "twenty couple at once; hands half round and back again\n",
      "the other way; down the middle and up again; round\n",
      "and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old\n",
      "top couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top\n",
      "couple starting off again, as soon as they got there; all top\n",
      "couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them! When\n",
      "this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his\n",
      "hands to stop the dance, cried out, \"Well done!\" and the\n",
      "fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially\n",
      "provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his\n",
      "reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no\n",
      "dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home,\n",
      "exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man\n",
      "resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more\n",
      "dances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there\n",
      "was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece\n",
      "of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer.\n",
      "But the great effect of the evening came after the Roast\n",
      "and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort\n",
      "of man who knew his business better than you or I could\n",
      "have told it him!) struck up \"Sir Roger de Coverley.\"  Then\n",
      "old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top\n",
      "couple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them;\n",
      "three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were\n",
      "not to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had no\n",
      "notion of walking.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if they had been twice as many--ah, four times--old\n",
      "Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would\n",
      "Mrs. Fezziwig. As to her, she was worthy to be his partner\n",
      "in every sense of the term. If that's not high praise, tell me\n",
      "higher, and I'll use it. A positive light appeared to issue\n",
      "from Fezziwig's calves. They shone in every part of the\n",
      "dance like moons. You couldn't have predicted, at any given\n",
      "time, what would have become of them next. And when old\n",
      "Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the dance;\n",
      "advance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and\n",
      "curtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to\n",
      "your place; Fezziwig \"cut\"--cut so deftly, that he appeared\n",
      "to wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without\n",
      "a stagger.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up.\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side\n",
      "of the door, and shaking hands with every person individually\n",
      "as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas.\n",
      "When everybody had retired but the two 'prentices, they did\n",
      "the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away,\n",
      "and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a\n",
      "counter in the back-shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a\n",
      "man out of his wits. His heart and soul were in the scene,\n",
      "and with his former self. He corroborated everything,\n",
      "remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent\n",
      "the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the\n",
      "bright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from\n",
      "them, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious\n",
      "that it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its\n",
      "head burnt very clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A small matter,\" said the Ghost, \"to make these silly\n",
      "folks so full of gratitude.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Small!\" echoed Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices,\n",
      "who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig:\n",
      "and when he had done so, said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of\n",
      "your mortal money: three or four perhaps. Is that so\n",
      "much that he deserves this praise?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't that,\" said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and\n",
      "speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self.\n",
      "\"It isn't that, Spirit. He has the power to render us happy\n",
      "or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a\n",
      "pleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and\n",
      "looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is\n",
      "impossible to add and count 'em up: what then? The happiness\n",
      "he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt the Spirit's glance, and stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the matter?\" asked the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing particular,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Something, I think?\" the Ghost insisted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Scrooge, \"No. I should like to be able to say\n",
      "a word or two to my clerk just now. That's all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance\n",
      "to the wish; and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by\n",
      "side in the open air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My time grows short,\" observed the Spirit. \"Quick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he\n",
      "could see, but it produced an immediate effect. For again\n",
      "Scrooge saw himself. He was older now; a man in the prime\n",
      "of life. His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later\n",
      "years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice.\n",
      "There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which\n",
      "showed the passion that had taken root, and where the\n",
      "shadow of the growing tree would fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young\n",

      "believed it was the same, until he saw her, now a comely\n",

      "and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not\n",
      "forty children conducting themselves like one, but every\n",
      "child was conducting itself like forty. The consequences\n",
      "were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care;\n",
      "on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily,\n",
      "and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to\n",
      "mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands\n",
      "most ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of\n",
      "them! Though I never could have been so rude, no, no! I\n",
      "wouldn't for the wealth of all the world have crushed that\n",
      "braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little\n",
      "shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to\n",

      "did, bold young brood, I couldn't have done it; I should\n",
      "have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment,\n",
      "and never come straight again. And yet I should\n",

      "looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never\n",
      "raised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of\n",
      "which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should\n",
      "have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence\n",

      "But now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a\n",
      "rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and\n",

      "and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who\n",
      "came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys\n",

      "into his mouth, and was more than suspected of having\n",
      "swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter!\n",
      "The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy,\n",
      "and gratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike.\n",
      "It is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions\n",

      "undisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Scrooge observed\n",
      "that its light was burning high and bright; and dimly\n",

      "from under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an\n",
      "irresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own\n",

      "sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had\n",
      "no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the\n",

      "in the right nick of time, for the especial purpose of holding\n",

      "capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for\n",

      "violent fit of trembling. Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter\n",
      "of an hour went by, yet nothing came. All this time, he lay\n",
      "upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy\n",
      "light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\n",
      "hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than\n",
      "a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it\n",
      "meant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive\n",
      "that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of\n",
      "spontaneous combustion, without having the consolation of\n",

      "in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done\n",
      "in it, and would unquestionably have done it too--at last, I\n",
      "say, he began to think that the source and secret of this\n",
      "ghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence,\n",
      "on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea taking\n",
      "full possession of his mind, he got up softly and shuffled in\n",
      "his slippers to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock, a strange\n",
      "voice called him by his name, and bade him enter. He\n",
      "obeyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was his own room. There was no doubt about that.\n",
      "But it had undergone a surprising transformation. The walls\n",
      "and ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a\n",
      "perfect grove; from every part of which, bright gleaming\n",
      "berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and\n",
      "ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had\n",
      "been scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring\n",
      "up the chimney, as that dull petrification of a hearth had\n",
      "never known in Scrooge's time, or Marley's, or for many and\n",
      "many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the floor, to form\n",
      "a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn,\n",

      "cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears,\n",
      "immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that\n",
      "made the chamber dim with their delicious steam. In easy\n",
      "state upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to\n",
      "see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty's\n",
      "horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge,\n",
      "as he came peeping round the door.\n",

      "bare, as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any\n",

      "garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other\n",
      "covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\n",
      "icicles. Its dark brown curls were long and free; free as its\n",
      "genial face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice,\n",
      "its unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded\n",
      "round its middle was an antique scabbard; but no sword\n",
      "was in it, and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust.\n",

      "The Ghost of Christmas Present rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit,\" said Scrooge submissively, \"conduct me where\n",

      "in the city streets on Christmas morning, where (for the\n",
      "weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk and\n",
      "not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the\n",
      "pavement in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of\n",
      "their houses, whence it was mad delight to the boys to see\n",
      "it come plumping down into the road below, and splitting\n",
      "into artificial little snow-storms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house fronts looked black enough, and the windows\n",
      "blacker, contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow\n",
      "upon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground;\n",
      "which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by\n",
      "the heavy wheels of carts and waggons; furrows that crossed\n",
      "and re-crossed each other hundreds of times where the great\n",
      "streets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace\n",
      "in the thick yellow mud and icy water. The sky was gloomy,\n",
      "and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist,\n",
      "half thawed, half frozen, whose heavier particles descended\n",
      "in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all the chimneys in Great\n",
      "Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were blazing away\n",
      "to their dear hearts' content. There was nothing very cheerful\n",
      "in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of\n",
      "cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest\n",
      "summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "For, the people who were shovelling away on the housetops\n",

      "snowball--better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest--\n",
      "laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it\n",
      "went wrong. The poulterers' shops were still half open, and the\n",
      "fruiterers' were radiant in their glory. There were great, round,\n",
      "pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats\n",
      "of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out\n",
      "into the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were\n",
      "ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in\n",
      "the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking\n",
      "from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went\n",
      "by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were\n",
      "pears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there\n",
      "were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers' benevolence\n",
      "to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people's mouths might\n",
      "water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy\n",
      "and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among\n",
      "the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered\n",
      "leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting\n",
      "off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great\n",
      "compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and\n",
      "beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after\n",
      "dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth among\n",
      "these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and\n",
      "stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was\n",
      "something going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and\n",
      "round their little world in slow and passionless excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Grocers'! oh, the Grocers'! nearly closed, with perhaps\n",
      "two shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such\n",
      "glimpses! It was not alone that the scales descending on the\n",
      "counter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller\n",
      "parted company so briskly, or that the canisters were rattled\n",
      "up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended\n",
      "scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even\n",
      "that the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so\n",
      "extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight,\n",
      "the other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and\n",
      "spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on\n",
      "feel faint and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that the figs\n",
      "were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in\n",
      "modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that\n",
      "everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but\n",
      "the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful\n",
      "promise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other\n",
      "at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left\n",
      "their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to\n",
      "fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in\n",
      "the best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people\n",
      "were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which\n",
      "they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own,\n",
      "worn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws\n",
      "to peck at if they chose.\n",
      "\n",
      "But soon the steeples called good people all, to church and\n",
      "chapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in\n",
      "their best clothes, and with their gayest faces. And at the\n",
      "same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and\n",
      "nameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners\n",
      "to the bakers' shops. The sight of these poor revellers\n",
      "appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with\n",
      "Scrooge beside him in a baker's doorway, and taking off the\n",
      "covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their\n",
      "dinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon kind\n",
      "of torch, for once or twice when there were angry words\n",
      "between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he\n",
      "shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good\n",
      "humour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame\n",
      "to quarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love\n",
      "it, so it was!\n",
      "\n",
      "In time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and\n",
      "yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners\n",
      "and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of\n",
      "wet above each baker's oven; where the pavement smoked as\n",
      "if its stones were cooking too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from\n",
      "your torch?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is. My own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?\"\n",
      "asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To any kindly given. To a poor one most.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why to a poor one most?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because it needs it most.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit,\" said Scrooge, after a moment's thought, \"I wonder\n",

      "desire to cramp these people's opportunities of innocent\n",
      "enjoyment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I!\" cried the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You would deprive them of their means of dining every\n",
      "seventh day, often the only day on which they can be said\n",
      "to dine at all,\" said Scrooge. \"Wouldn't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I!\" cried the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day?\" said\n",
      "Scrooge. \"And it comes to the same thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I seek!\" exclaimed the Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your\n",
      "name, or at least in that of your family,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are some upon this earth of yours,\" returned the Spirit,\n",
      "\"who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion,\n",
      "pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness\n",
      "in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and\n",
      "kin, as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge\n",
      "their doings on themselves, not us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge promised that he would; and they went on,\n",
      "invisible, as they had been before, into the suburbs of the\n",
      "town. It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which\n",
      "Scrooge had observed at the baker's), that notwithstanding\n",
      "his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place\n",
      "with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as\n",
      "gracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible\n",
      "he could have done in any lofty hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in\n",
      "showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind,\n",
      "generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor\n",
      "men, that led him straight to Scrooge's clerk's; for there he\n",
      "went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and\n",
      "on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped\n",
      "to bless Bob Cratchit's dwelling with the sprinkling of his\n",
      "torch. Think of that! Bob had but fifteen \"Bob\" a-week\n",
      "himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his\n",
      "Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present\n",
      "blessed his four-roomed house!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out\n",
      "but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons,\n",
      "which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and\n",
      "she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of\n",
      "her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter\n",
      "Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and\n",
      "getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob's private\n",
      "property, conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the\n",
      "day) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly\n",
      "attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks.\n",
      "And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing\n",
      "in, screaming that outside the baker's they had smelt the\n",
      "goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious\n",
      "thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced\n",
      "about the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the\n",
      "skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked\n",
      "him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up,\n",
      "knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and\n",
      "peeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What has ever got your precious father then?\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Cratchit. \"And your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Here's Martha, mother!\" said a girl, appearing as she\n",
      "spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's Martha, mother!\" cried the two young Cratchits.\n",
      "\"Hurrah! There's such a goose, Martha!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!\"\n",

      "her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'd a deal of work to finish up last night,\" replied the\n",

      "a warm, Lord bless ye!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no! There's father coming,\" cried the two young\n",
      "Cratchits, who were everywhere at once. \"Hide, Martha,\n",
      "hide!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father,\n",
      "with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe,\n",
      "hanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned\n",
      "up and brushed, to look seasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his\n",
      "shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and\n",
      "had his limbs supported by an iron frame!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, where's our Martha?\" cried Bob Cratchit, looking\n",
      "round.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not coming,\" said Mrs. Cratchit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not coming!\" said Bob, with a sudden declension in his\n",
      "high spirits; for he had been Tim's blood horse all the way\n",
      "from church, and had come home rampant. \"Not coming\n",
      "upon Christmas Day!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Martha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only\n",
      "in joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet\n",
      "door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits\n",
      "hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash-house,\n",
      "that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And how did little Tim behave?\" asked Mrs. Cratchit,\n",
      "when she had rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had\n",
      "hugged his daughter to his heart's content.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As good as gold,\" said Bob, \"and better. Somehow he\n",
      "gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the\n",
      "strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home,\n",
      "that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he\n",
      "was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember\n",
      "upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind\n",
      "men see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and\n",
      "trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing\n",
      "strong and hearty.\n",
      "\n",
      "His active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back\n",
      "came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by\n",
      "his brother and sister to his stool before the fire; and while\n",
      "Bob, turning up his cuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were\n",
      "capable of being made more shabby--compounded some hot\n",
      "mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round\n",
      "and round and put it on the hob to simmer; Master Peter,\n",
      "and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the\n",
      "goose, with which they soon returned in high procession.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose\n",
      "the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a\n",
      "black swan was a matter of course--and in truth it was\n",
      "something very like it in that house. Mrs. Cratchit made\n",
      "the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot;\n",
      "Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour;\n",
      "Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted\n",
      "the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny\n",
      "corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for\n",
      "everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard\n",
      "upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\n",
      "they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be\n",
      "helped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was\n",
      "said. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs.\n",
      "Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared\n",
      "to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the\n",
      "long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of\n",
      "delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim,\n",
      "excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with\n",
      "the handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!\n",
      "\n",
      "There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe\n",
      "there ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and\n",
      "flavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal\n",
      "admiration. Eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes,\n",
      "it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as\n",
      "Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small\n",
      "atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at\n",
      "last! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest\n",
      "Cratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to\n",
      "the eyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss\n",
      "Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous to\n",
      "bear witnesses--to take the pudding up and bring it in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should\n",
      "break in turning out! Suppose somebody should have got\n",
      "over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they\n",
      "were merry with the goose--a supposition at which the two\n",
      "young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were\n",
      "supposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of\n",
      "the copper. A smell like a washing-day! That was the\n",
      "cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook's next\n",
      "door to each other, with a laundress's next door to that!\n",
      "That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit\n",
      "entered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding,\n",
      "like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half\n",
      "of half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with\n",
      "Christmas holly stuck into the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly\n",
      "too, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by\n",
      "Mrs. Cratchit since their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that\n",
      "now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had\n",
      "had her doubts about the quantity of flour. Everybody had\n",
      "something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\n",
      "was at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have\n",
      "been flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed\n",
      "to hint at such a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the\n",
      "hearth swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the\n",
      "jug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges\n",
      "were put upon the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts on the\n",
      "fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth, in\n",
      "what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and\n",
      "at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.\n",
      "Two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.\n",
      "\n",
      "These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as\n",
      "golden goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with\n",
      "beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and\n",
      "cracked noisily. Then Bob proposed:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Which all the family re-echoed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God bless us every one!\" said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat very close to his father's side upon his little\n",
      "stool. Bob held his withered little hand in his, as if he\n",
      "loved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and\n",
      "dreaded that he might be taken from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit,\" said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt\n",
      "before, \"tell me if Tiny Tim will live.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see a vacant seat,\" replied the Ghost, \"in the poor\n",
      "chimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully\n",
      "preserved. If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future,\n",
      "the child will die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no,\" said Scrooge. \"Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he\n",
      "will be spared.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none\n",
      "other of my race,\" returned the Ghost, \"will find him here.\n",
      "What then? If he be like to die, he had better do it, and\n",
      "decrease the surplus population.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by\n",
      "the Spirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Man,\" said the Ghost, \"if man you be in heart, not\n",
      "adamant, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered\n",
      "What the surplus is, and Where it is. Will you decide what\n",
      "men shall live, what men shall die? It may be, that in the\n",
      "sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live\n",
      "than millions like this poor man's child. Oh God! to hear\n",
      "the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life\n",
      "among his hungry brothers in the dust!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke, and trembling cast\n",
      "his eyes upon the ground. But he raised them speedily, on\n",
      "hearing his own name.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Scrooge!\" said Bob; \"I'll give you Mr. Scrooge, the\n",
      "Founder of the Feast!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Founder of the Feast indeed!\" cried Mrs. Cratchit,\n",
      "reddening. \"I wish I had him here. I'd give him a piece\n",
      "of my mind to feast upon, and I hope he'd have a good\n",
      "appetite for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear,\" said Bob, \"the children! Christmas Day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,\" said she, \"on\n",
      "which one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard,\n",
      "unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge. You know he is, Robert!\n",
      "Nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear,\" was Bob's mild answer, \"Christmas Day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll drink his health for your sake and the Day's,\" said\n",
      "Mrs. Cratchit, \"not for his. Long life to him! A merry\n",
      "Christmas and a happy new year! He'll be very merry and\n",
      "very happy, I have no doubt!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The children drank the toast after her. It was the first of\n",
      "their proceedings which had no heartiness. Tiny Tim drank\n",
      "it last of all, but he didn't care twopence for it. Scrooge\n",
      "was the Ogre of the family. The mention of his name cast\n",
      "a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full\n",
      "five minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "After it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than\n",
      "before, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done\n",
      "with. Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his\n",
      "eye for Master Peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full\n",
      "five-and-sixpence weekly. The two young Cratchits laughed\n",
      "tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man of business;\n",
      "and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from\n",
      "between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular\n",
      "investments he should favour when he came into the receipt\n",
      "of that bewildering income. Martha, who was a poor\n",
      "apprentice at a milliner's, then told them what kind of work\n",
      "she had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch,\n",
      "and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a\n",
      "good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at\n",
      "home. Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some\n",
      "days before, and how the lord \"was much about as tall as\n",
      "Peter;\" at which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you\n",
      "couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All this\n",
      "time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and\n",
      "by-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in\n",
      "the snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice,\n",
      "and sang it very well indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing of high mark in this. They were not\n",
      "a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes\n",
      "were far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty;\n",
      "and Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside\n",
      "of a pawnbroker's. But, they were happy, grateful, pleased\n",
      "with one another, and contented with the time; and when\n",
      "they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings\n",
      "of the Spirit's torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon\n",
      "them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty\n",
      "heavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets,\n",
      "the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and\n",
      "all sorts of rooms, was wonderful. Here, the flickering of\n",
      "the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot\n",
      "plates baking through and through before the fire, and deep\n",
      "red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.\n",
      "There all the children of the house were running out\n",
      "into the snow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins,\n",
      "uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them. Here, again,\n",
      "were shadows on the window-blind of guests assembling; and\n",
      "there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted,\n",
      "and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\n",
      "neighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw\n",
      "them enter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!\n",
      "\n",
      "But, if you had judged from the numbers of people on\n",
      "their way to friendly gatherings, you might have thought\n",
      "that no one was at home to give them welcome when they\n",
      "got there, instead of every house expecting company, and\n",
      "piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\n",
      "the Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and\n",
      "opened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with\n",
      "a generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything\n",
      "within its reach! The very lamplighter, who ran on before,\n",
      "dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was\n",
      "dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly\n",
      "as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter\n",
      "that he had any company but Christmas!\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they\n",
      "stood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses\n",
      "of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place\n",
      "of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed,\n",
      "or would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner;\n",
      "and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass.\n",
      "Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\n",
      "red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a\n",
      "sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in\n",
      "the thick gloom of darkest night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What place is this?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels of\n",
      "the earth,\" returned the Spirit. \"But they know me. See!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they\n",
      "advanced towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and\n",
      "stone, they found a cheerful company assembled round a\n",
      "glowing fire. An old, old man and woman, with their\n",
      "children and their children's children, and another generation\n",
      "beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\n",
      "The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling\n",
      "of the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a\n",
      "Christmas song--it had been a very old song when he was a\n",
      "boy--and from time to time they all joined in the chorus.\n",
      "So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite\n",
      "blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour\n",
      "sank again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his\n",
      "robe, and passing on above the moor, sped--whither? Not\n",
      "to sea? To sea. To Scrooge's horror, looking back, he saw\n",
      "the last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them;\n",
      "and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it\n",
      "rolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it\n",
      "had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league\n",
      "or so from shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed,\n",
      "the wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse.\n",
      "Great heaps of sea-weed clung to its base, and storm-birds\n",
      "--born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-weed of the\n",
      "water--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even here, two men who watched the light had made\n",
      "a fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed\n",
      "out a ray of brightness on the awful sea. Joining their\n",
      "horny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they\n",
      "wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog; and\n",
      "one of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged and\n",
      "scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship\n",
      "might be: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in\n",
      "itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea\n",
      "--on, on--until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any\n",
      "shore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman\n",
      "at the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who\n",
      "had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations;\n",
      "but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\n",
      "had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his\n",
      "companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward\n",
      "hopes belonging to it. And every man on board, waking or\n",
      "sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another\n",
      "on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared\n",
      "to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those\n",
      "he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted\n",
      "to remember him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the\n",
      "moaning of the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it\n",
      "was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown\n",
      "abyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as Death: it\n",
      "was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, to hear\n",
      "a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge\n",
      "to recognise it as his own nephew's and to find himself in a\n",
      "bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling\n",
      "by his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving\n",
      "affability!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ha, ha!\" laughed Scrooge's nephew. \"Ha, ha, ha!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a\n",
      "man more blest in a laugh than Scrooge's nephew, all I can\n",
      "say is, I should like to know him too. Introduce him to me,\n",
      "and I'll cultivate his acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that\n",
      "while there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing\n",
      "in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and\n",
      "good-humour. When Scrooge's nephew laughed in this way: holding\n",
      "his sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the\n",
      "most extravagant contortions: Scrooge's niece, by marriage,\n",
      "laughed as heartily as he. And their assembled friends being\n",
      "not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!\" cried\n",
      "Scrooge's nephew. \"He believed it too!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"More shame for him, Fred!\" said Scrooge's niece,\n",
      "indignantly. Bless those women; they never do anything by\n",
      "halves. They are always in earnest.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was very pretty: exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled,\n",
      "surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that\n",
      "seemed made to be kissed--as no doubt it was; all kinds of\n",
      "good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another\n",
      "when she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever\n",
      "saw in any little creature's head. Altogether she was what\n",
      "you would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory, too.\n",
      "Oh, perfectly satisfactory.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's a comical old fellow,\" said Scrooge's nephew, \"that's\n",
      "the truth: and not so pleasant as he might be. However,\n",
      "his offences carry their own punishment, and I have nothing\n",
      "to say against him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sure he is very rich, Fred,\" hinted Scrooge's niece.\n",
      "\"At least you always tell me so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What of that, my dear!\" said Scrooge's nephew. \"His\n",
      "wealth is of no use to him. He don't do any good with it.\n",
      "He don't make himself comfortable with it. He hasn't the\n",
      "satisfaction of thinking--ha, ha, ha!--that he is ever going\n",
      "to benefit US with it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have no patience with him,\" observed Scrooge's niece.\n",
      "Scrooge's niece's sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed\n",
      "the same opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I have!\" said Scrooge's nephew. \"I am sorry for\n",
      "him; I couldn't be angry with him if I tried. Who suffers\n",
      "by his ill whims! Himself, always. Here, he takes it into\n",
      "his head to dislike us, and he won't come and dine with us.\n",
      "What's the consequence? He don't lose much of a dinner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,\" interrupted\n",
      "Scrooge's niece. Everybody else said the same, and they\n",
      "must be allowed to have been competent judges, because\n",
      "they had just had dinner; and, with the dessert upon the\n",
      "table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well! I'm very glad to hear it,\" said Scrooge's nephew,\n",
      "\"because I haven't great faith in these young housekeepers.\n",
      "What do you say, Topper?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge's niece's\n",
      "sisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast,\n",
      "who had no right to express an opinion on the subject.\n",
      "Whereat Scrooge's niece's sister--the plump one with the lace\n",
      "tucker: not the one with the roses--blushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do go on, Fred,\" said Scrooge's niece, clapping her hands.\n",
      "\"He never finishes what he begins to say! He is such a\n",
      "ridiculous fellow!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge's nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was\n",
      "impossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister\n",
      "tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was\n",
      "unanimously followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was only going to say,\" said Scrooge's nephew, \"that\n",
      "the consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making\n",
      "merry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant\n",
      "moments, which could do him no harm. I am sure he loses\n",
      "pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts,\n",
      "either in his mouldy old office, or his dusty chambers. I\n",
      "mean to give him the same chance every year, whether he\n",
      "likes it or not, for I pity him. He may rail at Christmas\n",
      "till he dies, but he can't help thinking better of it--I defy\n",
      "him--if he finds me going there, in good temper, year after\n",
      "year, and saying Uncle Scrooge, how are you? If it only\n",
      "puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds,\n",
      "that's something; and I think I shook him yesterday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking\n",
      "Scrooge. But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much\n",
      "caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any\n",
      "rate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the\n",
      "bottle joyously.\n",
      "\n",
      "After tea, they had some music. For they were a musical\n",
      "family, and knew what they were about, when they sung a\n",
      "Glee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper, who\n",
      "could growl away in the bass like a good one, and never\n",
      "swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face\n",
      "over it. Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and\n",
      "played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing:\n",
      "you might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had\n",
      "been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the\n",
      "boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of\n",
      "Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the\n",
      "things that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he\n",
      "softened more and more; and thought that if he could have\n",
      "listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the\n",
      "kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands,\n",
      "without resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob\n",
      "Marley.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After\n",
      "a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children\n",
      "sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its\n",
      "mighty Founder was a child himself. Stop! There was first\n",
      "a game at blind-man's buff. Of course there was. And I\n",
      "no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he\n",
      "had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done\n",
      "thing between him and Scrooge's nephew; and that the\n",
      "Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after\n",
      "that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the\n",
      "credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons,\n",
      "tumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano,\n",
      "smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went,\n",
      "there went he! He always knew where the plump sister was.\n",
      "He wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had fallen up\n",
      "against him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would\n",
      "have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would\n",
      "have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly\n",
      "have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister.\n",
      "She often cried out that it wasn't fair; and it really was not.\n",
      "But when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her\n",
      "silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got\n",
      "her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his\n",
      "conduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not to\n",
      "know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her\n",
      "head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by\n",
      "pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain\n",
      "about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told\n",
      "him her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in\n",
      "office, they were so very confidential together, behind the\n",
      "curtains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge's niece was not one of the blind-man's buff party,\n",
      "but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool,\n",
      "in a snug corner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close\n",
      "behind her. But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her\n",
      "love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet.\n",
      "Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was\n",
      "very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat\n",
      "her sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper\n",
      "could have told you. There might have been twenty people there,\n",
      "young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for\n",
      "wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that\n",
      "his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with\n",
      "his guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too;\n",
      "for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut\n",
      "in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in\n",
      "his head to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood,\n",
      "and looked upon him with such favour, that he begged like\n",
      "a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed. But\n",
      "this the Spirit said could not be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here is a new game,\" said Scrooge. \"One half hour,\n",
      "Spirit, only one!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew\n",
      "had to think of something, and the rest must find out what;\n",
      "he only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case\n",
      "was. The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed,\n",
      "elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live\n",
      "animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an\n",
      "animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes,\n",
      "and lived in London, and walked about the streets,\n",
      "and wasn't made a show of, and wasn't led by anybody, and\n",
      "didn't live in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market,\n",
      "and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a\n",
      "tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every fresh\n",
      "question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a\n",
      "fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that\n",
      "he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp. At last\n",
      "the plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know\n",
      "what it is!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it?\" cried Fred.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Which it certainly was. Admiration was the universal\n",
      "sentiment, though some objected that the reply to \"Is it a\n",
      "bear?\" ought to have been \"Yes;\" inasmuch as an answer\n",
      "in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts\n",
      "from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency\n",
      "that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure,\" said\n",
      "Fred, \"and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health.\n",

      "moment; and I say, 'Uncle Scrooge!'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well! Uncle Scrooge!\" they cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old\n",
      "man, whatever he is!\" said Scrooge's nephew. \"He wouldn't\n",
      "take it from me, but may he have it, nevertheless. Uncle\n",
      "Scrooge!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light\n",
      "of heart, that he would have pledged the unconscious\n",
      "company in return, and thanked them in an inaudible speech,\n",
      "if the Ghost had given him time. But the whole scene\n",
      "passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his\n",
      "nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they\n",
      "visited, but always with a happy end. The Spirit stood\n",
      "beside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign lands,\n",
      "and they were close at home; by struggling men, and they\n",
      "were patient in their greater hope; by poverty, and it was\n",
      "rich. In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery's every\n",
      "refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not\n",
      "made fast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his\n",
      "blessing, and taught Scrooge his precepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge\n",
      "had his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared\n",
      "to be condensed into the space of time they passed\n",
      "together. It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained\n",
      "unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly\n",
      "older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of\n",
      "it, until they left a children's Twelfth Night party, when,\n",
      "looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place,\n",
      "he noticed that its hair was grey.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are spirits' lives so short?\" asked Scrooge.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,\" was\n",
      "the Spirit's sorrowful reply. \"Look here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "From the foldings of its robe, it brought two children;\n",
      "wretched, abject, frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt\n",
      "down at its feet, and clung upon the outside of its garment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Man! look here. Look, look, down here!\" exclaimed\n",
      "the Ghost.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling,\n",
      "wolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility. Where\n",
      "graceful youth should have filled their features out, and\n",
      "touched them with its freshest tints, a stale and shrivelled\n",
      "hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and\n",
      "pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\n",
      "enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No\n",
      "change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any\n",
      "grade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has\n",
      "monsters half so horrible and dread.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to\n",
      "him in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but\n",
      "the words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie\n",
      "of such enormous magnitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit! are they yours?\" Scrooge could say no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are Man's,\" said the Spirit, looking down upon\n",
      "them. \"And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers.\n",
      "This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both,\n",
      "and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for\n",
      "on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the\n",
      "writing be erased. Deny it!\" cried the Spirit, stretching out\n",
      "its hand towards the city. \"Slander those who tell it ye!\n",
      "Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse.\n",
      "And bide the end!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have they no refuge or resource?\" cried Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are there no prisons?\" said the Spirit, turning on him\n",
      "for the last time with his own words. \"Are there no workhouses?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The bell struck twelve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not.\n",
      "As the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the\n",
      "prediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting up his eyes,\n",
      "beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like\n",
      "a mist along the ground, towards him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "STAVE IV:  THE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n",
      "\n",
      "THE Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. When\n",
      "it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in\n",
      "the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to\n",
      "scatter gloom and mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed\n",
      "its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible\n",
      "save one outstretched hand. But for this it would have been\n",
      "difficult to detach its figure from the night, and separate it\n",
      "from the darkness by which it was surrounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside\n",
      "him, and that its mysterious presence filled him with a\n",
      "solemn dread. He knew no more, for the Spirit neither\n",
      "spoke nor moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To\n",
      "Come?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its\n",
      "hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are about to show me shadows of the things that\n",
      "have not happened, but will happen in the time before us,\"\n",
      "Scrooge pursued. \"Is that so, Spirit?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The upper portion of the garment was contracted for an\n",
      "instant in its folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head.\n",
      "That was the only answer he received.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although well used to ghostly company by this time,\n",
      "Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled\n",
      "beneath him, and he found that he could hardly stand when\n",
      "he prepared to follow it. The Spirit paused a moment, as\n",
      "observing his condition, and giving him time to recover.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him\n",
      "with a vague uncertain horror, to know that behind the\n",
      "dusky shroud, there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon\n",
      "him, while he, though he stretched his own to the utmost,\n",
      "could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap\n",
      "of black.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ghost of the Future!\" he exclaimed, \"I fear you more\n",
      "than any spectre I have seen. But as I know your purpose\n",
      "is to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another\n",
      "man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you company,\n",
      "and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak\n",
      "to me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight\n",
      "before them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lead on!\" said Scrooge. \"Lead on! The night is\n",
      "waning fast, and it is precious time to me, I know. Lead\n",
      "on, Spirit!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Phantom moved away as it had come towards him.\n",
      "Scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress, which bore him\n",
      "up, he thought, and carried him along.\n",
      "\n",
      "They scarcely seemed to enter the city; for the city rather\n",
      "seemed to spring up about them, and encompass them of its\n",
      "own act. But there they were, in the heart of it; on\n",
      "'Change, amongst the merchants; who hurried up and down,\n",
      "and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in\n",
      "groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully\n",
      "with their great gold seals; and so forth, as Scrooge had\n",
      "seen them often.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men.\n",
      "Observing that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge\n",
      "advanced to listen to their talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, \"I\n",

      "dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When did he die?\" inquired another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Last night, I believe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, what was the matter with him?\" asked a third,\n",
      "taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box.\n",
      "\"I thought he'd never die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God knows,\" said the first, with a yawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What has he done with his money?\" asked a red-faced\n",
      "gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his\n",
      "nose, that shook like the gills of a turkey-cock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't heard,\" said the man with the large chin,\n",
      "yawning again. \"Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn't\n",
      "left it to me. That's all I know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This pleasantry was received with a general laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's likely to be a very cheap funeral,\" said the same\n",
      "speaker; \"for upon my life I don't know of anybody to go\n",
      "to it. Suppose we make up a party and volunteer?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't mind going if a lunch is provided,\" observed the\n",
      "gentleman with the excrescence on his nose. \"But I must\n",
      "be fed, if I make one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,\"\n",
      "said the first speaker, \"for I never wear black gloves, and I\n",
      "never eat lunch. But I'll offer to go, if anybody else will.\n",
      "When I come to think of it, I'm not at all sure that I wasn't\n",
      "his most particular friend; for we used to stop and speak\n",
      "whenever we met. Bye, bye!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Speakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with\n",
      "other groups. Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the\n",
      "Spirit for an explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed\n",
      "to two persons meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking\n",
      "that the explanation might lie here.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business:\n",
      "very wealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point\n",
      "always of standing well in their esteem: in a business point\n",
      "of view, that is; strictly in a business point of view.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How are you?\" said one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How are you?\" returned the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well!\" said the first. \"Old Scratch has got his own at\n",
      "last, hey?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I am told,\" returned the second. \"Cold, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seasonable for Christmas time. You're not a skater, I\n",
      "suppose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. No. Something else to think of. Good morning!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Not another word. That was their meeting, their\n",
      "conversation, and their parting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the\n",
      "Spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so\n",
      "trivial; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden\n",
      "purpose, he set himself to consider what it was likely to be.\n",
      "They could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the\n",
      "death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was Past, and this\n",
      "Ghost's province was the Future. Nor could he think of any\n",
      "one immediately connected with himself, to whom he could\n",
      "apply them. But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they\n",
      "applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement,\n",
      "he resolved to treasure up every word he heard,\n",
      "and everything he saw; and especially to observe the\n",
      "shadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation\n",
      "that the conduct of his future self would give him\n",
      "the clue he missed, and would render the solution of these\n",
      "riddles easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked about in that very place for his own image; but\n",
      "another man stood in his accustomed corner, and though the\n",
      "clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he\n",
      "saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured\n",
      "in through the Porch. It gave him little surprise, however;\n",
      "for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life, and\n",
      "thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried\n",
      "out in this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its\n",
      "outstretched hand. When he roused himself from his\n",
      "thoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand, and\n",
      "its situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes\n",
      "were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder, and feel\n",
      "very cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part\n",
      "of the town, where Scrooge had never penetrated before,\n",
      "although he recognised its situation, and its bad repute. The\n",
      "ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched;\n",
      "the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly. Alleys and\n",
      "archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of\n",
      "smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the\n",
      "whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Far in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed,\n",
      "beetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags,\n",
      "bottles, bones, and greasy offal, were bought. Upon the floor\n",
      "within, were piled up heaps of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges,\n",
      "files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds. Secrets\n",
      "that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in\n",
      "mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and\n",
      "sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a\n",
      "charcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal,\n",
      "nearly seventy years of age; who had screened himself from the\n",
      "cold air without, by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous\n",
      "tatters, hung upon a line; and smoked his pipe in all the luxury\n",
      "of calm retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this\n",
      "man, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the\n",
      "shop. But she had scarcely entered, when another woman,\n",
      "similarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by\n",
      "a man in faded black, who was no less startled by the sight\n",
      "of them, than they had been upon the recognition of each\n",
      "other. After a short period of blank astonishment, in which\n",
      "the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all three\n",
      "burst into a laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let the charwoman alone to be the first!\" cried she who\n",
      "had entered first. \"Let the laundress alone to be the second;\n",
      "and let the undertaker's man alone to be the third. Look\n",
      "here, old Joe, here's a chance! If we haven't all three met\n",
      "here without meaning it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You couldn't have met in a better place,\" said old Joe,\n",
      "removing his pipe from his mouth. \"Come into the parlour.\n",
      "You were made free of it long ago, you know; and the other\n",
      "two an't strangers. Stop till I shut the door of the shop.\n",
      "Ah! How it skreeks! There an't such a rusty bit of metal\n",
      "in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I'm sure there's\n",
      "no such old bones here, as mine. Ha, ha! We're all suitable\n",
      "to our calling, we're well matched. Come into the\n",
      "parlour. Come into the parlour.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The\n",
      "old man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and\n",
      "having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night), with the\n",
      "stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth again.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he did this, the woman who had already spoken\n",
      "threw her bundle on the floor, and sat down in a flaunting\n",
      "manner on a stool; crossing her elbows on her knees, and\n",
      "looking with a bold defiance at the other two.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What odds then! What odds, Mrs. Dilber?\" said the\n",
      "woman. \"Every person has a right to take care of themselves.\n",
      "He always did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's true, indeed!\" said the laundress. \"No man\n",
      "more so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why then, don't stand staring as if you was afraid,\n",
      "woman; who's the wiser? We're not going to pick holes in\n",
      "each other's coats, I suppose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed!\" said Mrs. Dilber and the man together.\n",
      "\"We should hope not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, then!\" cried the woman. \"That's enough.\n",
      "Who's the worse for the loss of a few things like these?\n",
      "Not a dead man, I suppose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed,\" said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead, a wicked old\n",
      "screw,\" pursued the woman, \"why wasn't he natural in his\n",
      "lifetime? If he had been, he'd have had somebody to look\n",
      "after him when he was struck with Death, instead of lying\n",
      "gasping out his last there, alone by himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the truest word that ever was spoke,\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Dilber. \"It's a judgment on him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish it was a little heavier judgment,\" replied the\n",
      "woman; \"and it should have been, you may depend upon it,\n",
      "if I could have laid my hands on anything else. Open that\n",
      "bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it. Speak out\n",
      "plain. I'm not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to\n",
      "see it. We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves,\n",
      "before we met here, I believe. It's no sin. Open the bundle,\n",
      "Joe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this;\n",
      "and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first,\n",
      "produced his plunder. It was not extensive. A seal or two,\n",
      "a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no\n",
      "great value, were all. They were severally examined and\n",
      "appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed\n",
      "to give for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a\n",
      "total when he found there was nothing more to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's your account,\" said Joe, \"and I wouldn't give\n",
      "another sixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it.\n",
      "Who's next?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing\n",
      "apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of\n",
      "sugar-tongs, and a few boots. Her account was stated on the wall\n",
      "in the same manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I always give too much to ladies. It's a weakness of mine,\n",
      "and that's the way I ruin myself,\" said old Joe. \"That's\n",
      "your account. If you asked me for another penny, and made\n",
      "it an open question, I'd repent of being so liberal and knock\n",
      "off half-a-crown.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now undo my bundle, Joe,\" said the first woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience\n",
      "of opening it, and having unfastened a great many knots,\n",
      "dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you call this?\" said Joe. \"Bed-curtains!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward\n",
      "on her crossed arms. \"Bed-curtains!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't mean to say you took 'em down, rings and\n",
      "all, with him lying there?\" said Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes I do,\" replied the woman. \"Why not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You were born to make your fortune,\" said Joe, \"and\n",
      "you'll certainly do it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I certainly shan't hold my hand, when I can get anything\n",
      "in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He\n",
      "was, I promise you, Joe,\" returned the woman coolly. \"Don't\n",
      "drop that oil upon the blankets, now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His blankets?\" asked Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whose else's do you think?\" replied the woman. \"He\n",
      "isn't likely to take cold without 'em, I dare say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope he didn't die of anything catching? Eh?\" said\n",
      "old Joe, stopping in his work, and looking up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you be afraid of that,\" returned the woman. \"I\n",
      "an't so fond of his company that I'd loiter about him for\n",
      "such things, if he did. Ah! you may look through that\n",
      "shirt till your eyes ache; but you won't find a hole in it, nor\n",
      "a threadbare place. It's the best he had, and a fine one too.\n",
      "They'd have wasted it, if it hadn't been for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you call wasting of it?\" asked old Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,\" replied\n",
      "the woman with a laugh. \"Somebody was fool enough to\n",
      "do it, but I took it off again. If calico an't good enough for\n",
      "such a purpose, it isn't good enough for anything. It's quite\n",
      "as becoming to the body. He can't look uglier than he did\n",
      "in that one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat\n",
      "grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by\n",
      "the old man's lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and\n",
      "disgust, which could hardly have been greater, though they\n",
      "had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ha, ha!\" laughed the same woman, when old Joe,\n",
      "producing a flannel bag with money in it, told out their\n",
      "several gains upon the ground. \"This is the end of it, you\n",
      "see! He frightened every one away from him when he was\n",
      "alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit!\" said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. \"I\n",
      "see, I see. The case of this unhappy man might be my own.\n",
      "My life tends that way, now. Merciful Heaven, what is\n",
      "this!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now\n",
      "he almost touched a bed: a bare, uncurtained bed: on which,\n",
      "beneath a ragged sheet, there lay a something covered up,\n",
      "which, though it was dumb, announced itself in awful\n",
      "language.\n",
      "\n",
      "The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with\n",
      "any accuracy, though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience\n",
      "to a secret impulse, anxious to know what kind of room it\n",
      "was. A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon\n",
      "the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept,\n",
      "uncared for, was the body of this man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand\n",
      "was pointed to the head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted\n",
      "that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon\n",
      "Scrooge's part, would have disclosed the face. He thought\n",
      "of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to do it;\n",
      "but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss\n",
      "the spectre at his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar\n",
      "here, and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy\n",
      "command: for this is thy dominion! But of the loved,\n",
      "revered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair\n",
      "to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is\n",
      "not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released;\n",
      "it is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the\n",
      "hand WAS open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm,\n",
      "and tender; and the pulse a man's. Strike, Shadow, strike!\n",
      "And see his good deeds springing from the wound, to sow\n",
      "the world with life immortal!\n",
      "\n",
      "No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and\n",
      "yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed. He\n",
      "thought, if this man could be raised up now, what would be\n",
      "his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard-dealing, griping cares?\n",
      "They have brought him to a rich end, truly!\n",
      "\n",
      "He lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a\n",
      "woman, or a child, to say that he was kind to me in this\n",
      "or that, and for the memory of one kind word I will be\n",
      "kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was\n",
      "a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone. What\n",
      "they wanted in the room of death, and why they were so\n",
      "restless and disturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit!\" he said, \"this is a fearful place. In leaving it,\n",
      "I shall not leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the\n",
      "head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I understand you,\" Scrooge returned, \"and I would do\n",
      "it, if I could. But I have not the power, Spirit. I have\n",
      "not the power.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again it seemed to look upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion\n",
      "caused by this man's death,\" said Scrooge quite agonised,\n",
      "\"show that person to me, Spirit, I beseech you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a\n",
      "moment, like a wing; and withdrawing it, revealed a room\n",
      "by daylight, where a mother and her children were.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness;\n",
      "for she walked up and down the room; started at every\n",
      "sound; looked out from the window; glanced at the clock;\n",
      "tried, but in vain, to work with her needle; and could hardly\n",
      "bear the voices of the children in their play.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried\n",
      "to the door, and met her husband; a man whose face was\n",
      "careworn and depressed, though he was young. There was\n",
      "a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of serious delight\n",
      "of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to repress.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for\n",
      "him by the fire; and when she asked him faintly what news\n",
      "(which was not until after a long silence), he appeared\n",
      "embarrassed how to answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it good?\" she said, \"or bad?\"--to help him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bad,\" he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are quite ruined?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. There is hope yet, Caroline.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he relents,\" she said, amazed, \"there is! Nothing is\n",
      "past hope, if such a miracle has happened.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is past relenting,\" said her husband. \"He is dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke\n",
      "truth; but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she\n",
      "said so, with clasped hands. She prayed forgiveness the next\n",
      "moment, and was sorry; but the first was the emotion of\n",
      "her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last\n",
      "night, said to me, when I tried to see him and obtain a\n",
      "week's delay; and what I thought was a mere excuse to avoid\n",
      "me; turns out to have been quite true. He was not only\n",
      "very ill, but dying, then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To whom will our debt be transferred?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know. But before that time we shall be ready\n",
      "with the money; and even though we were not, it would be\n",
      "a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his\n",
      "successor. We may sleep to-night with light hearts, Caroline!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter.\n",
      "The children's faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what\n",
      "they so little understood, were brighter; and it was a happier\n",
      "house for this man's death! The only emotion that the\n",
      "Ghost could show him, caused by the event, was one of\n",
      "pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,\" said\n",
      "Scrooge; \"or that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just\n",
      "now, will be for ever present to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar\n",
      "to his feet; and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and\n",
      "there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen. They\n",
      "entered poor Bob Cratchit's house; the dwelling he had\n",
      "visited before; and found the mother and the children seated\n",
      "round the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as\n",
      "still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter,\n",
      "who had a book before him. The mother and her daughters\n",
      "were engaged in sewing. But surely they were very quiet!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'And He took a child, and set him in the midst of\n",
      "them.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Where had Scrooge heard those words? He had not\n",
      "dreamed them. The boy must have read them out, as he\n",
      "and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why did he not\n",
      "go on?\n",
      "\n",
      "The mother laid her work upon the table, and put her\n",
      "hand up to her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The colour hurts my eyes,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They're better now again,\" said Cratchit's wife. \"It\n",
      "makes them weak by candle-light; and I wouldn't show weak\n",
      "eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world. It\n",
      "must be near his time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Past it rather,\" Peter answered, shutting up his book.\n",
      "\"But I think he has walked a little slower than he used,\n",
      "these few last evenings, mother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a\n",
      "steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have known him walk with--I have known him walk\n",
      "with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so have I,\" cried Peter. \"Often.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so have I,\" exclaimed another. So had all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But he was very light to carry,\" she resumed, intent upon\n",
      "her work, \"and his father loved him so, that it was no\n",
      "trouble: no trouble. And there is your father at the door!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter\n",
      "--he had need of it, poor fellow--came in. His tea\n",
      "was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should\n",
      "help him to it most. Then the two young Cratchits got\n",
      "upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against\n",
      "his face, as if they said, \"Don't mind it, father. Don't be\n",
      "grieved!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to\n",
      "all the family. He looked at the work upon the table, and\n",
      "praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls.\n",
      "They would be done long before Sunday, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?\" said his\n",
      "wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, my dear,\" returned Bob. \"I wish you could have\n",
      "gone. It would have done you good to see how green a\n",
      "place it is. But you'll see it often. I promised him that I\n",
      "would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little child!\"\n",
      "cried Bob. \"My little child!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He broke down all at once. He couldn't help it. If he\n",
      "could have helped it, he and his child would have been farther\n",
      "apart perhaps than they were.\n",
      "\n",
      "He left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above,\n",
      "which was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas.\n",
      "There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were\n",
      "signs of some one having been there, lately. Poor Bob sat\n",
      "down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed\n",
      "himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what\n",
      "had happened, and went down again quite happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "They drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother\n",
      "working still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness\n",
      "of Mr. Scrooge's nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but\n",
      "once, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and seeing\n",
      "that he looked a little--\"just a little down you know,\" said\n",
      "Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him. \"On\n",
      "which,\" said Bob, \"for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman\n",
      "you ever heard, I told him. 'I am heartily sorry for it, Mr.\n",
      "Cratchit,' he said, 'and heartily sorry for your good wife.'\n",
      "By the bye, how he ever knew that, I don't know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Knew what, my dear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, that you were a good wife,\" replied Bob.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everybody knows that!\" said Peter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well observed, my boy!\" cried Bob. \"I hope they\n",
      "do. 'Heartily sorry,' he said, 'for your good wife. If I\n",
      "can be of service to you in any way,' he said, giving me\n",
      "his card, 'that's where I live. Pray come to me.' Now, it\n",
      "wasn't,\" cried Bob, \"for the sake of anything he might be\n",
      "able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was\n",
      "quite delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our\n",
      "Tiny Tim, and felt with us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sure he's a good soul!\" said Mrs. Cratchit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You would be surer of it, my dear,\" returned Bob, \"if\n",
      "you saw and spoke to him. I shouldn't be at all surprised--\n",
      "mark what I say!--if he got Peter a better situation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only hear that, Peter,\" said Mrs. Cratchit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And then,\" cried one of the girls, \"Peter will be keeping\n",
      "company with some one, and setting up for himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get along with you!\" retorted Peter, grinning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's just as likely as not,\" said Bob, \"one of these days;\n",
      "though there's plenty of time for that, my dear. But however\n",
      "and whenever we part from one another, I am sure we\n",
      "shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim--shall we--or this\n",
      "first parting that there was among us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never, father!\" cried they all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I know,\" said Bob, \"I know, my dears, that when\n",
      "we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he\n",
      "was a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among\n",
      "ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, never, father!\" they all cried again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very happy,\" said little Bob, \"I am very happy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the\n",
      "two young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook\n",
      "hands. Spirit of Tiny Tim, thy childish essence was from\n",
      "God!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spectre,\" said Scrooge, \"something informs me that our\n",
      "parting moment is at hand. I know it, but I know not\n",
      "how. Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as\n",
      "before--though at a different time, he thought: indeed, there\n",
      "seemed no order in these latter visions, save that they were\n",
      "in the Future--into the resorts of business men, but showed\n",
      "him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for anything,\n",
      "but went straight on, as to the end just now desired,\n",
      "until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This court,\" said Scrooge, \"through which we hurry now,\n",
      "is where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length\n",
      "of time. I see the house. Let me behold what I shall be,\n",
      "in days to come!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The house is yonder,\" Scrooge exclaimed. \"Why do you\n",
      "point away?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The inexorable finger underwent no change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked\n",
      "in. It was an office still, but not his. The furniture was\n",
      "not the same, and the figure in the chair was not himself.\n",
      "The Phantom pointed as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "He joined it once again, and wondering why and whither\n",
      "he had gone, accompanied it until they reached an iron gate.\n",
      "He paused to look round before entering.\n",
      "\n",
      "A churchyard. Here, then; the wretched man whose name\n",
      "he had now to learn, lay underneath the ground. It was a\n",
      "worthy place. Walled in by houses; overrun by grass and\n",
      "weeds, the growth of vegetation's death, not life; choked up\n",
      "with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A\n",
      "worthy place!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to\n",
      "One. He advanced towards it trembling. The Phantom was\n",
      "exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new\n",
      "meaning in its solemn shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,\"\n",
      "said Scrooge, \"answer me one question. Are these the\n",
      "shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of\n",
      "things that May be, only?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which\n",
      "it stood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if\n",
      "persevered in, they must lead,\" said Scrooge. \"But if the\n",
      "courses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is\n",
      "thus with what you show me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spirit was immovable as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and\n",
      "following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected\n",
      "grave his own name, EBENEZER SCROOGE.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Am I that man who lay upon the bed?\" he cried, upon\n",
      "his knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Spirit! Oh no, no!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The finger still was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spirit!\" he cried, tight clutching at its robe, \"hear me!\n",
      "I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must\n",
      "have been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, if I\n",
      "am past all hope!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time the hand appeared to shake.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good Spirit,\" he pursued, as down upon the ground he\n",
      "fell before it: \"Your nature intercedes for me, and pities\n",
      "me. Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you\n",
      "have shown me, by an altered life!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The kind hand trembled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it\n",
      "all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the\n",
      "Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I\n",
      "will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I\n",
      "may sponge away the writing on this stone!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In his agony, he caught the spectral hand. It sought to\n",
      "free itself, but he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it.\n",
      "The Spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate\n",
      "reversed, he saw an alteration in the Phantom's hood and dress.\n",
      "It shrunk, collapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "STAVE V:  THE END OF IT\n",
      "\n",
      "YES! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own,\n",
      "the room was his own. Best and happiest of all, the Time\n",
      "before him was his own, to make amends in!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!\"\n",
      "Scrooge repeated, as he scrambled out of bed. \"The Spirits\n",

      "it on my knees, old Jacob; on my knees!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions,\n",
      "that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his\n",

      "\n",
      "\"They are not torn down,\" cried Scrooge, folding one of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Walk-ER!\" exclaimed the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no,\" said Scrooge, \"I am in earnest. Go and buy\n",
      "it, and tell 'em to bring it here, that I may give them the\n",
      "direction where to take it. Come back with the man, and\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady\n",
      "one, but write it he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to\n",
      "open the street door, ready for the coming of the poulterer's\n",
      "man. As he stood there, waiting his arrival, the knocker\n",
      "caught his eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall love it, as long as I live!\" cried Scrooge, patting\n",
      "it with his hand. \"I scarcely ever looked at it before.\n",
      "What an honest expression it has in its face! It's a\n",
      "wonderful knocker!--Here's the Turkey! Hallo! Whoop!\n",
      "How are you! Merry Christmas!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a Turkey! He never could have stood upon his\n",
      "legs, that bird. He would have snapped 'em short off in a\n",
      "minute, like sticks of sealing-wax.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it's impossible to carry that to Camden Town,\"\n",
      "said Scrooge. \"You must have a cab.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with\n",
      "which he paid for the Turkey, and the chuckle with which\n",
      "he paid for the cab, and the chuckle with which he recompensed\n",
      "the boy, were only to be exceeded by the chuckle\n",
      "with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and\n",
      "chuckled till he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to\n",
      "shake very much; and shaving requires attention, even when\n",
      "you don't dance while you are at it. But if he had cut the\n",
      "end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of\n",
      "sticking-plaister over it, and been quite satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "He dressed himself \"all in his best,\" and at last got out\n",
      "into the streets. The people were by this time pouring forth,\n",
      "as he had seen them with the Ghost of Christmas Present;\n",
      "and walking with his hands behind him, Scrooge regarded\n",
      "every one with a delighted smile. He looked so irresistibly\n",
      "pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured fellows\n",
      "said, \"Good morning, sir! A merry Christmas to you!\"\n",
      "And Scrooge said often afterwards, that of all the blithe\n",
      "sounds he had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not gone far, when coming on towards him he\n",
      "beheld the portly gentleman, who had walked into his\n",
      "counting-house the day before, and said, \"Scrooge and Marley's, I\n",
      "believe?\"  It sent a pang across his heart to think how this\n",
      "old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but he\n",
      "knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear sir,\" said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and\n",
      "taking the old gentleman by both his hands. \"How do you\n",
      "do? I hope you succeeded yesterday. It was very kind of\n",
      "you. A merry Christmas to you, sir!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Scrooge?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Scrooge. \"That is my name, and I fear it\n",
      "may not be pleasant to you. Allow me to ask your pardon.\n",
      "And will you have the goodness\"--here Scrooge whispered in\n",
      "his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord bless me!\" cried the gentleman, as if his breath\n",
      "were taken away. \"My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you please,\" said Scrooge. \"Not a farthing less. A\n",
      "great many back-payments are included in it, I assure you.\n",
      "Will you do me that favour?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear sir,\" said the other, shaking hands with him.\n",
      "\"I don't know what to say to such munifi--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't say anything, please,\" retorted Scrooge. \"Come\n",
      "and see me. Will you come and see me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will!\" cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he\n",
      "meant to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank'ee,\" said Scrooge. \"I am much obliged to you.\n",
      "I thank you fifty times. Bless you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He went to church, and walked about the streets, and\n",
      "watched the people hurrying to and fro, and patted children\n",
      "on the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into\n",
      "the kitchens of houses, and up to the windows, and found\n",
      "that everything could yield him pleasure. He had never\n",
      "dreamed that any walk--that anything--could give him so\n",
      "much happiness. In the afternoon he turned his steps\n",
      "towards his nephew's house.\n",
      "\n",
      "He passed the door a dozen times, before he had the\n",
      "courage to go up and knock. But he made a dash, and\n",
      "did it:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is your master at home, my dear?\" said Scrooge to the\n",
      "girl. Nice girl! Very.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is he, my love?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I'll\n",
      "show you up-stairs, if you please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank'ee. He knows me,\" said Scrooge, with his hand\n",
      "already on the dining-room lock. \"I'll go in here, my dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the door.\n",
      "They were looking at the table (which was spread out in\n",
      "great array); for these young housekeepers are always nervous\n",
      "on such points, and like to see that everything is right.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fred!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started!\n",
      "Scrooge had forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting\n",
      "in the corner with the footstool, or he wouldn't have done\n",
      "it, on any account.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why bless my soul!\" cried Fred, \"who's that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner.\n",
      "Will you let me in, Fred?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Let him in! It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off.\n",
      "He was at home in five minutes. Nothing could be heartier.\n",
      "His niece looked just the same. So did Topper when he\n",
      "came. So did the plump sister when she came. So did\n",
      "every one when they came. Wonderful party, wonderful\n",
      "games, wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!\n",
      "\n",
      "But he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was\n",
      "early there. If he could only be there first, and catch Bob\n",
      "Cratchit coming late! That was the thing he had set his\n",
      "heart upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No\n",
      "Bob. A quarter past. No Bob. He was full eighteen\n",
      "minutes and a half behind his time. Scrooge sat with his\n",
      "door wide open, that he might see him come into the Tank.\n",
      "\n",
      "His hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter\n",
      "too. He was on his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his\n",
      "pen, as if he were trying to overtake nine o'clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hallo!\" growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice, as\n",
      "near as he could feign it. \"What do you mean by coming\n",
      "here at this time of day?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very sorry, sir,\" said Bob. \"I am behind my time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are?\" repeated Scrooge. \"Yes. I think you are.\n",
      "Step this way, sir, if you please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's only once a year, sir,\" pleaded Bob, appearing from\n",
      "the Tank. \"It shall not be repeated. I was making rather\n",
      "merry yesterday, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,\" said Scrooge, \"I\n",
      "am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer. And\n",
      "therefore,\" he continued, leaping from his stool, and giving\n",
      "Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into\n",
      "the Tank again; \"and therefore I am about to raise your\n",
      "salary!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He\n",
      "had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it,\n",
      "holding him, and calling to the people in the court for help\n",
      "and a strait-waistcoat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A merry Christmas, Bob!\" said Scrooge, with an earnestness\n",
      "that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the\n",
      "back. \"A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I\n",
      "have given you, for many a year! I'll raise your salary, and\n",
      "endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss\n",
      "your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of\n",
      "smoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires, and buy another\n",
      "coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and\n",
      "infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was\n",
      "a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a\n",
      "master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or\n",
      "any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old\n",
      "world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him,\n",
      "but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was\n",
      "wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this\n",
      "globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill\n",
      "of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these\n",
      "would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they\n",
      "should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in\n",
      "less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was\n",
      "quite enough for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon\n",
      "the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was\n",
      "always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas\n",
      "well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that\n",
      "be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim\n",

      "finally dominating her first masters. But Spain's victorious course,\n",
      "splendid as it was in letters, arts, and arms, was comparatively brief.\n",
      "The heroic age of her literature extends over some hundred and fifty\n",
      "years, from the accession of Carlos Quinto to the death of Felipe IV.\n",
      "This period has been treated, as it deserves, at greater length than\n",
      "any other. The need of compression, confronting me at every page,\n",

      "The most ancient monuments of Castilian literature can be referred\n",
      "to no time later than the twelfth century, and they have been dated\n",
      "earlier with some plausibility. As with men of Spanish stock, so\n",
      "with their letters: the national idiosyncrasy is emphaticâalmost\n",
      "violent. French literature is certainly more exquisite, more brilliant;\n",
      "English is loftier and more varied; but in the capital qualities of\n",
      "originality, force, truth, and humour, the Castilian finds no superior.\n",
      "The Basques, who have survived innumerable onsets (among them, the\n",
      "ridicule of Rabelais and the irony of Cervantes), are held by some\n",
      "to be representatives of the Stone-age folk who peopled the east,\n",
      "north-east, and south of Spain. This notion is based mainly upon the\n",
      "fact that all true Basque names for cutting instruments are derived\n",
      "from the word _aitz_ (flint). Howbeit, the Basques vaunt no literary\n",
      "history in the true sense. The _Leloaren Cantua_ (_Song of Lelo_) has\n",
      "been accepted as a contemporary hymn written in celebration of a\n",
      "Basque triumph over Augustus. Its date is uncertain, and its refrain\n",
      "of \"_Lelo_\" seems a distorted reminiscence of the Arabic catchword _LÄ\n",
      "ilÄh illÄ 'llÄh_; but the _Leloaren Cantua_ is assuredly no older than\n",
      "the sixteenth century.\n",
      "\n",
      "A second performance in this sort is the _Altobiskarko Cantua_ (_Song\n",
      "of Altobiskar_). Altobiskar is a hill near Roncesvalles, where\n",
      "the Basques are said to have defeated Charlemagne; and the song\n",
      "commemorates the victory. Written in a rhythm without fellow in the\n",
      "Basque metres, it contains names like Roland and Ganelon, which are in\n",
      "themselves proofs of French origin; but, as it has been widely received\n",
      "as genuine, the facts concerning it must be told. First written in\n",
      "French (_circa_ 1833) by FranÃ§ois EugÃ¨ne Garay de Monglave, it was\n",
      "translated into very indifferent Basque by a native of Espelette named\n",
      "Louis Duhalde, then a student in Paris. The too-renowned _Altobiskarko\n",
      "Cantua_ is therefore a simple hoax: one might as well attribute\n",
      "_Rule Britannia_ to Boadicea. The conquerors of Roncesvalles wrote\n",
      "no triumphing song: three centuries later the losers immortalised\n",
      "their own overthrow in the _Chanson de Roland_, where the disaster is\n",
      "credited to the Arabs, and the Basques are merely mentioned by the way.\n",
      "Early in the twelfth century there was written a Latin _Chronicle_\n",
      "ascribed to Archbishop Turpin, an historical personage who ruled the\n",
      "see of Rheims some two hundred years before his false _Chronicle_ was\n",
      "written. The opening chapters of this fictitious history are probably\n",
      "due to an anonymous Spanish monk cloistered at Santiago de Compostela;\n",
      "and it is barely possible that this late source was utilised by such\n",
      "modern Basques as JosÃ© MarÃ­a Goizcueta, who retouched and \"restored\"\n",
      "the _Altobiskarko Cantua_ in ignorant good faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "However that may prove, no existing Basque song is much more than three\n",
      "hundred years old. One single Basque of genius, the Chancellor Pero\n",
      "LÃ³pez de Ayala, shines a portent in the literature of the fourteenth\n",
      "century; and even so, he writes in Castilian. He stands alone, isolated\n",
      "from his race. The oldest Basque book, well named as _LinguÃ¦ Vasconum\n",
      "PrimitiÃ¦_, is a collection of exceedingly minor verse by Bernard\n",
      "Dechepare, curÃ© of Saint-Michel, near Saint-Jean Pied de Port; and\n",
      "its date is modern (1545). Pedro de Axular is the first Basque who\n",
      "shows any originality in his native tongue; and, characteristically\n",
      "enough, he deals with religious matters. Though he lived at Sare, in\n",
      "the Basses PyrÃ©nÃ©es, he was a Spaniard from Navarre; and he flourished\n",
      "in the seventeenth century (1643). It is true that a small knot of\n",
      "second-class Basqueâthe epic poet Ercilla y ZÃºÃ±iga, and the fabulist\n",
      "Iriarteâfigure in Castilian literature; but the Basque glories are\n",
      "to be sought in other fieldâin such heroic personages as Ignacio\n",
      "Loyola, and his mightier disciple Francisco Xavier. Setting aside\n",
      "devotional and didactic works, mostly translated from other tongues,\n",
      "Basque literature is chiefly oral, and has but a formal connection\n",
      "with the history of Spanish letters. Within narrow geographical\n",
      "limits the Basque language still thrives, and on each slope of the\n",
      "Pyrenees holds its own against forces apparently irresistible. But\n",
      "its vitality exceeds its reproductive force: it survives but does not\n",
      "multiply. Whatever the former influence of Basque on Castilianâan\n",
      "influence never greatâit has now ceased; while Castilian daily tends\n",
      "to supplant (or, at least, to supplement) Basque. Spain's later\n",
      "invadersâIberians, Kelts, PhÅnicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Alani,\n",
      "Suevi, Goths, and Arabsâhave left but paltry traces on the prevailing\n",
      "form of Spanish speech, which derives from Latin by a descent more\n",
      "obvious, though not a whit more direct, than the descent of French.\n",
      "So frail is the partition which divides the Latin mother from her\n",
      "noblest daughter, that late in the sixteenth century Fernando PÃ©rez\n",
      "de Oliva wrote a treatise that was at once Latin and Spanish: a thing\n",
      "intelligible in either tongue and futile in both, though held for\n",
      "praiseworthy in an age when the best poets chose to string lines into a\n",
      "polyglot rosary, without any distinction save that of antic dexterity.\n",
      "\n",
      "For our purpose, the dawn of literature in Spain begins with the\n",
      "Roman conquest. In colonies like Pax Augusta (Badajoz), CÃ¦sar Augusta\n",
      "(Zaragoza), and Emerita Augusta (MÃ©rida), the Roman influence was\n",
      "strengthened by the intermarriage of Roman soldiers with Spanish women.\n",
      "All over Spain there arose the _odiosa cantio_, as St. Augustine calls\n",
      "it, of Spanish children learning Latin; and every school formed a fresh\n",
      "centre of Latin authority. With their laws, the conquerors imposed\n",
      "their speech upon the broken tribes; and these, in turn, invaded\n",
      "the capital of Latin politics and letters. The breath of Spanish\n",
      "genius informs the Latinity of the Silver Age. Augustus himself had\n",
      "named his Spanish freedman, Gaius Julius Hyginus, the Chief Keeper\n",
      "of the Palatine Library. Spanish literary aptitude, showing stronger\n",
      "in the prodigious learning of the Elder Seneca, matures in the\n",
      "altisonant rhetoric and violent colouring of the Younger, in Lucan's\n",
      "declamatory eloquence and metallic music, in Martial's unblushing\n",
      "humour and brutal cynicism, in Quintilian's luminous judgment and wise\n",
      "sententiousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these display in germ the characteristic points of strength and\n",
      "weakness which were to be developed in the evolution of Spanish\n",
      "literature; and their influence on letters was matched by their\n",
      "countrymen's authority on affairs. The Spaniard Balbus was the first\n",
      "barbarian to reach the Consulship, and to receive the honour of a\n",
      "public triumph; the Spaniard Trajan was the first barbarian named\n",
      "Emperor, the first Emperor to make the Tigris the eastern boundary of\n",
      "his dominion, and the only Emperor whose ashes were allowed to rest\n",
      "within the Roman city-walls. And the victory of the vanquished was\n",
      "complete when the Spaniard Hadrian, the author of the famous versesâ\n",

      "to the accession of Commodus\"; and the Spaniard, accounting Marcus\n",
      "Aurelius as a son of CÃ³rdoba, vaunts with reasonable pride, that of\n",
      "those eighty perfect, golden years, three-score at least were passed\n",
      "beneath the sceptre of the Spanish CÃ¦sars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Withal, individual success apart, the Spanish utterance of Latin teased\n",
      "the finer ear. Cicero ridiculed the accentâ_aliquid pingue_âof\n",
      "even the more lettered Spaniards who reached Rome; Martial, retired\n",
      "to his native Bilbilis, shuddered lest he might let fall a local\n",
      "idiom; and Quintilian, a sterner purist than a very Roman, frowned at\n",
      "the intrusion of his native provincialisms upon the everyday talk of\n",
      "the capital. In Rome incorrections of speech were found where least\n",
      "expected. That Catullus should jeer at Arriusâthe forerunner of a\n",
      "London typeâin the matter of aspirates is natural enough; but even\n",
      "Augustus distressed the nice grammarian. _A fortiori_, Hadrian was\n",
      "taunted with his Spanish solecisms. Innovation won the day. The century\n",
      "between Livy and Tacitus shows differences of style inexplicable by the\n",
      "easy theory of varieties of temperament; and the two centuries dividing\n",
      "Tacitus from St. Augustine are marked by changes still more striking.\n",
      "This is but another illustration of the old maxim, that as the speed of\n",
      "falling bodies increases with distance, so literary decadences increase\n",
      "with time.\n",

      "As in Italy and Africa, so in Spain. The statelier _sermo urbanus_\n",
      "yielded to the _sermo plebeius_. Spanish soldiers had discovered\n",
      "\"the fatal secret of empire, that emperors could be made elsewhere\n",
      "than at Rome\"; no less fatal was the discovery that Latin might be\n",
      "spoken without regard for Roman models. As the power of classic forms\n",
      "waned, that of ecclesiastical examples grew. Church Latin of the\n",
      "fourth century shines at its best in the verse of the Christian poet,\n",
      "the Spaniard Prudentius: with him the classical rhythms persistâas\n",
      "survivals. He clutches at, rather than grasps, the Roman verse\n",
      "tradition, and, though he has no rhyming stanzas, he verges on rhyme\n",
      "in such performances as his _Hymnus ad Galli Cantum_. Throughout the\n",
      "noblest period of Roman poetry, soldiers, sailors, and illiterates\n",
      "had, in the _versus saturnius_, preserved a native rhythmical system\n",
      "not quantitative but accentual; and this vulgar metrical method was to\n",
      "outlive its fashionable rival. It is doubtful whether the quantitative\n",
      "prosody, brought from Greece by literary dandies, ever flourished\n",
      "without the circle of professional men of letters. It is indisputable\n",
      "that the imported metrical rules, depending on the power of vowels and\n",
      "the position of consonants, were gradually superseded by looser laws of\n",
      "syllabic quantity wherein accent and tonic stress were the main factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the empire fell, Spain became the easy prey of northern\n",
      "barbarians, who held the country by the sword, and intermarried but\n",
      "little with its people. To the Goths Spain owes nothing but eclipse\n",
      "and ruin. No books, no inscriptions of Gothic origin survive; the\n",
      "Gongoristic letters ascribed to King Sisebut are not his work, and\n",
      "it is doubtful if the Goths bequeathed more than a few words to the\n",
      "Spanish vocabulary. The defeat of Roderic by Tarik and MÅ«sa laid Spain\n",
      "open to the Arab rush. National sentiment was unborn. Witiza and\n",
      "Roderic were regarded by Spaniards as men in Italy and Africa regarded\n",
      "Totila and Galimar. The clergy were alienated from their Gothic rulers.\n",
      "Gothic favourites were appointed to non-existent dioceses carrying huge\n",
      "revenues; a single Goth held two sees simultaneously; and, by way of\n",
      "balance, Toledo was misgoverned by two rival Gothic bishops. Harassed\n",
      "by a severe penal code, the Jew hailed the invading Arabs as a kindred,\n",
      "oriental, circumcised race; and, with the heathen slaves, they went\n",
      "over to the conquerors. So obscure is the history of the ensuing years\n",
      "that it has been said that the one thing certain is Roderic's name.\n",
      "Not less certain is it that, within a brief space, almost the entire\n",
      "peninsula was subdued. The more warlike Spaniards,\n",

      "rendering of the gospels, wherein the Virgilian hexameter is aped with\n",

      "forgotten; but he deserves remembrance because of his achievement\n",
      "as an epigraphist, and because he moved his friend, St. Jerome, to\n",
      "translate the Bible. To him succeeds Hosius of CÃ³rdoba, the mentor of\n",
      "Constantine, the champion of Athanasian orthodoxy, and the presiding\n",

      "the use of MuzÃ¡rabes; and still stronger evidence of the low estate of\n",

      "sometimes composed in Arabic rather than in their native Hebrew; and it\n",

      "Alvarus Cordubiensis, St. Eulogius deposes that certain Christiansâhe\n",
      "mentions Isaac the Martyr by nameâspoke Arabic to perfection. Nor can\n",
      "it be pleaded that this zeal was invariably due to official pressure:\n",
      "on the contrary, a caliph went the length of forbidding Spanish Jews\n",
      "and Christians to learn Arabic. Neither did the fashion die soon:\n",
      "long after the Arab predominance was shaken, Arabic was the modish\n",

      "superscription, was invented to combat the Almoravide _dÄ«nÄr_, which\n",
      "rivalled the popularity of the Constantinople besant; and as late as\n",
      "the thirteenth century Spanish coins were struck with Arabic symbols on\n",
      "the reverse side.\n",

      "Yet, even so, the rude Latin of the unconquered north remained\n",
      "well-nigh intact. Save in isolated centres, it was spoken by countless\n",

      "of Tingitana. Vast deduction must be made from the jeremiads of Paulus\n",
      "Alvarus Cordubiensis. As he bewails the time wasted on Hebrew and\n",

      "the customs of the Spaniards; and the Castilian-speaking Arabâthe\n",
      "_moro latinado_âmultiplied prodigiously. No small proportion of Arab\n",
      "writersâIbn Hazm, for exampleâwas made up of sons or grandsons\n",
      "of Spaniards, not unacquainted with their fathers' speech. When\n",

      "Henricus Seynensis, who lives eternal by mistaking the _Talmud_â\"Rabbi\n",
      "Talmud\"âfor a man. But no Arab work endures. And as with Arab\n",
      "philosophy in Spain, so with the Arabic language: its soul was required\n",
      "of it. Hebrew, indeed, was not forgotten; and for Arabic, a revival\n",
      "might be expected during the Crusades. Yet in all Europe, outside\n",
      "Spain, but three isolated Arabists of that time are knownâWilliam of\n",
      "Tyre, Philip of Tripoli, and Adelard of Bath; and in Spain itself,\n",
      "when Boabdil surrendered in 1492, the tide had run so low that not a\n",
      "thousand Arabs in Granada could speak their native tongue. Nearly two\n",
      "centuries before (in 1311-12) a council under Pope Clement V. advised\n",
      "the establishment of Arabic chairs in the universities of Salamanca,\n",
      "Bologna, Paris, and Oxford. Save at Bologna, the counsel was ignored;\n",

      "Save a group of technical words, the sole literary legacy bequeathed\n",
      "to Spain by the Arabs was their alphabet. This they used in writing\n",
      "Castilian, calling their transcription _aljamÃ­a_ (_ajami_ = foreign),\n",
      "which was the original name of the broken Latin spoken by the\n",
      "MuzÃ¡rabes. First introduced in legal documents, the practice was\n",
      "prudently continued during the reconquest, and, besides its secrecy,\n",
      "was further recommended by the fact that a special sanctity attaches\n",
      "to Arabic characters. But the peculiarity of _aljamÃ­a_ is that it\n",
      "begot a literature of its own, though, naturally enough, a literature\n",
      "modelled on the Spanish. Its best production is the _Poema de Yusuf_;\n",
      "and it may be noted that this, like its much later fellow, _La Alabanza\n",
      "de Mahoma_ (The Praise of Muhammad), is in the metre of the old Spanish\n",
      "\"clerkly poems\" (_poesÃ­as de clerecÃ­a_). So also the Aragonese Morisco,\n",
      "Muhammad RabadÃ¡n, writes his cyclic poem in Spanish octosyllabics; and\n",

      "a characteristic Galician measure (_de gaita gallega_). The subjects\n",
      "of the _textos aljamiados_ are frankly conveyed from Western sources:\n",
      "the _Compilation of Alexander_, an orientalised version of the French;\n",

      "without his turban, as a full-fledged Spanish poet; and the old\n",
      "tradition of servility is continued by an anonymous refugee in Tunis,\n",
      "who shows himself an authority on the plays and the lyric verse of Lope\n",
      "de Vega.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is therefore erroneous to suppose that the northern Spaniards on\n",
      "their southward march fell in with numerous kinsmen, of wider culture\n",
      "and of a higher civilisation, whose everyday speech was unintelligible\n",
      "to them, and who prayed to Christ in the tongue of Muhammad. Such\n",
      "cases may have occurred, but as the rarest exceptions. Not less\n",
      "unfounded is the theory that Castilian is a fusion of southern\n",
      "academic Arabic with barbarous northern Latin. In southern Spain Latin\n",
      "persisted, as Greek, Syriac, and Coptic persisted in other provinces\n",
      "of the Caliphate; and in the school founded at CÃ³rdoba by the Abbot\n",

      "read as assiduously as Sallust, Horace, and Terence were studied in\n",
      "the northern provinces. Granting that Latin was for a while so much\n",
      "neglected that it was necessary to translate the Bible into Arabic, it\n",
      "is also true that Arabic grew so forgotten that Peter the Venerable\n",
      "was forced to translate the Ku'rÄn for the benefit of clerks. Lastly,\n",
      "it must be borne in mind that the variety of Romance which finally\n",

      "The French school, then, is strong in Spain, omnipotent in Portugal,\n",

      "but a few degrees less marked in the one country than in the other.\n",
      "As it is, Alfonso the Learned ranks with any Portuguese of them all;\n",
      "and it is reasonable to think that he had fellows whose achievement\n",
      "and names have not reached us. For Spanish literature and ourselves\n",
      "the loss is grave; and yet we cannot conceive that there existed in\n",
      "early Castilian any examples comparable in elaborate lyrical beauty to\n",
      "the _cantars d'amigo_ which the Galician-Portuguese singers borrowed\n",
      "from the French _ballettes_. In the first place, if they had existed,\n",

      "should survive. Next, the idea is intrinsically improbable, since the\n",
      "Castilian language was not yet sufficiently ductile for the purpose.\n",
      "Moreover, from the outset there is a counter-current in Castile. The\n",
      "early Spanish legends are mostly concerned with Spanish subjects. Apart\n",
      "from obvious foreign touches in the early recensions of the story of\n",
      "Bernaldo de Carpio (who figures as Charlemagne's nephew), the tone of\n",
      "the ballads is hostile to the French, and, as is natural, the enmity\n",
      "grows more pronounced with time. That national hero, the Cid, is\n",
      "especially anti-French. He casts the King of France in gaol; he throws\n",
      "away the French King's chair with insult in St. Peter's. Still more\n",
      "significant is the fact that the character of French women becomes\n",
      "a jest. Thus, the balladist emphasises the fact that the faithless\n",
      "wife of Garci-FernÃ¡ndez is French; and, again, when Sancho GarcÃ­a's\n",
      "mother, likewise French, appears in a _romance_, the singer gives her\n",
      "a blackamoorâan Arabâas a lover. This is primitive man's little\n",
      "way, the world over: he pays off old scores by deriding the virtue of\n",
      "his enemy's wife, mother, daughter, sister; and in primitive Spain\n",
      "the Frenchwoman is the lightning-conductor of international scandals,\n",
      "tolerable by the camp-fire, but tedious in print.\n",
      "\n",
      "In considering early Spanish verse it behoves us to denote facts\n",
      "and to be chary in drawing inferences. Thus, while we admit that\n",
      "the _Poema del Cid_ and the _Chanson de Roland_ belong to the same\n",
      "_genre_, we can go no further. It is not to be assumed that similarity\n",
      "of incident necessarily implies direct imitation. The introduction of\n",
      "the fighting bishop in the Cid poem is a case in point. His presence\n",
      "in the field may beâalmost certainly isâan historic event, common\n",
      "enough in days when a militant bishop loved to head a charge; and the\n",
      "chronicler may well have seen the exploits which he records. It by\n",
      "no means follows, and it is extravagant to suppose, that the Spanish\n",
      "_juglar_ merely filches from the _Chanson de Roland_. That he had\n",
      "heard the _Chanson_ is not only probable, but likely; it is not, to\n",
      "say the least, a necessary consequence that he annexed an episode as\n",
      "familiar in Spain as elsewhere. Nothing, if you probe deep enough, is\n",
      "new, and originality is a vain dream. But some margin must be left for\n",
      "personal experience and the hazard of circumstance; and if we take\n",
      "account of the chances of coincidence, the debt of Castilian to French\n",
      "literature will appear in its due perspective. Nor must it be forgotten\n",
      "that from a very early date there are traces of the reflex action of\n",
      "Castilian upon French literature. They are not, indeed, many; but they\n",

      "mosaic of the Church of Sant' Apollinare della CittÃ  at Ravenna;\n",
      "and here, again, the insertion is probably a pious afterthought. If\n",

      "older than the end of the twelfth century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enough of it remains to show that the Spanish workman improved upon his\n",
      "models. He elaborates the dramatic action, quickens the dialogue with\n",
      "newer life, and gives his scene an ampler, a more vivid atmosphere.\n",
      "Led by the heavenly star, the three Magi first appear separately, then\n",
      "together; they celebrate the birth of Christ, whom they seek to adore,\n",
      "at the end of their thirteen days' pilgrimage. Encountering Herod,\n",
      "they confide to him their mission; the King conjures his \"abbots\"\n",
      "(rabbis), counsellors, and soothsayers to search the mystic books, and\n",
      "to say whether the Magis' tale be true. The passages between Herod\n",
      "and his rabbis are marked by intensity and passion, far exceeding the\n",

      "progress of mechanism, distribution, and rapidity.\n",

      "There is even a breath of the critical spirit wholly absent from\n",
      "all other early mysteries, which accept the miraculous sign of the\n",

      "This misnamed epic, no unworthy fellow to the _Chanson de Roland_, is\n",
      "the first great monument of Spanish literature. Like the _Misterio\n",

      "reaches us maimed and mutilated. The beginning is lost; a page in the\n",
      "middle, containing some fifty lines following upon verse 2338, has\n",
      "gone astray from our copy; and the end has been retouched by unskilful\n",
      "fingers. The unique manuscript in which the _cantar_ exists belongs to\n",
      "the fourteenth century: so much is now settled after infinite disputes.\n",

      "Nevertheless, in its surviving shape it is the result of innumerable\n",
      "retouches which amount to botching. Its authorship is more than\n",
      "doubtful, for the Per Abbat who obtrudes in the closing lines is,\n",
      "like the Turoldus of _Roland_, the mere transcriber of an unfaithful\n",
      "copy. Our gratitude to Per Abbat is dashed with regret for his\n",
      "slapdash methods. The assonants are roughly handled, whole phrases are\n",
      "unintelligently repeated, are transferred from one line to another, or\n",
      "are thrust out from the text, and in some cases two lines are crushed\n",
      "into one. The prevailing metre is the Alexandrine or fourteen-syllabled\n",
      "verse, probably adopted in conscious imitation of that Latin chronicle\n",

      "in the first part of _Don Quixote_ (chapter xlix.). Unquestionably\n",
      "the Cid lived in the flesh: whether or not his alleged achievements\n",
      "occurred is another matter. Irony has incidentally marked him for its\n",

      "orthodoxy; the cunning intriguer who rifled Jews and mocked at treaties\n",
      "is transfigured as the chivalrous paladin; the unsentimental trooper\n",
      "who never loved is delivered unto us as the typical _jeune premier_.\n",

      "title (_Sidi_ = lord). Yet two points must be kept in mind: the facts\n",
      "which discredit him are reported by hostile Arab historians; and,\n",
      "again, the Cid is entitled to be judged by the standard of his country\n",
      "and his time. So judged, we may accept the verdict of his enemies, who\n",
      "cursed him as \"a miracle of the miracles of God and the conqueror of\n",
      "banners.\" Ruy Diaz de Bivarâto give him his true nameâwas something\n",
      "more than a freebooter whose deeds struck the popular fancy: he stood\n",
      "for unity, for the supremacy of Castile over LeÃ³n, and his example\n",
      "proved that, against almost any odds, the Spaniards could hold their\n",
      "own against the Moors. In the long night between the disaster of\n",
      "Alarcos and the crowning triumph of Navas de Tolosa, the Cid's figure\n",
      "grew glorious as that of the man who had never despaired of his\n",

      "not forgotten. From his death at Valencia in 1099, his memory became a\n",

      "\n",
      "In the _Poema_ the treatment is obviously modelled upon the _Chanson de\n",
      "Roland_. But there is a fixed intent to place the Spaniard first. The\n",

      "Cid Campeador. Bishop Turpin opens the battle in _Roland_, and Bishop\n",
      "Jerome heads the charge for Spain. Roland and Ruy Diaz are absolved\n",
      "and exhorted to the same effect, and the resemblance of the epithet\n",
      "_curunez_ applied to the French bishop is too close to the _coronado_\n",
      "of the Spaniard to be accidental. But allowing for the fact that the\n",
      "Spanish _juglar_ borrows his framework, his performance is great by\n",
      "virtue of its simplicity, its strength, its spirit and fire. Whether\n",
      "he deals with the hungry loyalty of the Cid in exile, or his reception\n",
      "into favour by an ingrate king; whether he celebrates the overthrow of\n",
      "the Count of Barcelona or the surrender of Valencia; whether he sings\n",
      "the nuptials of Elvira and Sol with the Infantes de CarriÃ³n, or the\n",
      "avenging Cid who seeks reparation from his craven son-in-law, the touch\n",

      "\n",
      "There is an unity of conception and of language which forbids our\n",

      "of the Infantes de CarriÃ³n, and the proud announcement that the kings\n",
      "of Spain are sprung from the Cid's loins. In both the singer rises to\n",
      "the level of his subject, but his chiefest gust is in the recital of\n",
      "some brilliant deed of arms. Judge him when, in a famous passage well\n",
      "rendered by Ormsby, he sings the charge of the Cid at Alcocer:â\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"_With bucklers braced before their breasts, with lances pointing low,\n",

      "  And he that in a good hour was born, his clarion voice rings out,\n",
      "  And clear above the clang of arms is heard his battle-shout,\n",
      "  'Among them, gentlemen! Strike home for the love of charity!\n",
      "  The Champion of Bivar is hereâRuy DiazâI am he!'\n",

      "  Down go three hundred Moors to earth, a man to every blow;\n",
      "  And, when they wheel, three hundred more, as charging back they go.\n",
      "  It was a sight to see the lances rise and fall that day;\n",
      "  The shivered shields and riven mail, to see how thick they lay;\n",

      "\n",
      "Indubitably this (and it were easy to match it elsewhere in the\n",
      "_Poema_) is the work of an original genius who redeems his superficial\n",
      "borrowings of incident from _Roland_ by a treatment all his own. That\n",
      "he knew the French models is evident from his skilful conveyance of the\n",
      "bear episode in _Ider_ to his own pages, where the Cid encounters the\n",
      "beast as a lion. But the language shows no hint of French influence,\n",
      "and both thought and expression are profoundly national. The poet's\n",
      "name is irrecoverable, but the internal evidence points strongly to\n",
      "the conclusion that he came from the neighbourhood of Medina Celi.\n",
      "The surmise that he was an Asturian rests solely upon the absence of\n",
      "the diphthong _ue_ from his lines, an inference on the face of it\n",
      "unwarrantable. Against this is the topographical minuteness with which\n",
      "the poet reports the sallies of the Cid in the districts of CastejÃ³n\n",
      "and Alcocer; his marked ignorance of the country round Zaragoza and\n",
      "Valencia, his detailed description of the central episodeâthe outrage\n",
      "upon the Cid's daughters in the wood of Corpes, near Berlanga; and\n",
      "the important fact that the four chief itineraries in the _Poema_\n",
      "are charged with minutiÃ¦ from Molina to San Esteban de Gormaz, while\n",
      "they grow vague and more confused as they extend towards Burgos and\n",
      "Valencia. The most probable conjecture, then, is that the unknown maker\n",
      "of this primitive masterpiece came from the Valle de Arbujuelo; and\n",
      "it is worth adding that this opinion is supported by the authority\n",
      "of Sr. MenÃ©ndez Pidal. Perhaps the greatest testimony to the early\n",
      "poet's worth is to be found in this: that his conception of his hero\n",
      "has outlived the true historic Cid, and has forced the child of his\n",
      "imagination upon the acceptance of mankind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even more fantastic is the personality of Ruy Diaz as rendered by\n",

      "and more especially of the Adventures of the Cid). The composition\n",
      "which bears this clumsy and inappropriate title is better named the\n",

      "of rugged prose. Not till after digressions into other episodes,\n",
      "and irrelevant stories of Miro and Bernardo, Bishops of Palencia,\n",
      "probably fellow-townsmen of the compiler, does the Cid appear. He is\n",
      "no longer, as in the _Poema_, a popular hero, idealised from historic\n",

      "fables accumulated in course of time. At the age of twelve he slays\n",
      "GÃ³mez GÃ³rmaz (an almost impossible style, compounded of a patronymic\n",

      "King'sâFernando'sâtroops to the gates of Paris, defeating the Count\n",
      "of Savoy upon the road. One legend is heaped upon another, and the\n",
      "poem, the end of which is lost, breaks off with the Pope's request\n",
      "for a year's truce, which Fernando, acting as ever upon the Cid's\n",
      "advice, magnanimously extends for twelve years. It is hard to say\n",
      "whether the _Cantar de Rodrigo_ as we have it is the production of\n",
      "a single composer, or whether it is a patchwork by different hands,\n",
      "arranged from earlier poems, and eked out by prose stories and by oral\n",
      "traditions. The versification is that of the simple sixteen-syllabled\n",
      "line, each hemistich of which forms a typical _romance_ line. This\n",
      "in itself is a sign of its later date, and to this must be added\n",
      "the traces of deliberate imitation of the _Poema_, and the writer's\n",
      "familiarity with such modern devices as heraldic emblems. Further,\n",
      "the use of a ProvenÃ§al form like _gensor_, the unmistakable tokens of\n",
      "French influence, the anticipation of the metre of the clerkly poems,\n",
      "the writer's frank admission of earlier songs on the same subject,\n",
      "the metamorphosis of the Cid into a feudal baron, and, above all, the\n",
      "decadent spirit of the entire work: these are tokens which imply a\n",
      "relative modernity. Much of the obscurity of language, which has been\n",
      "mistaken for archaism, is simply due to the defects of the manuscript;\n",
      "and the evidence goes to show that the _Rodrigo_, put together in the\n",
      "last decade of the twelfth century or the first of the thirteenth, was\n",
      "retouched in the fourteenth by Spanish _juglares_ humiliated by the\n",
      "recent French invasions. Even so, much of the primitive _pastiche_\n",
      "remains, and the _Rodrigo_, which is mentioned in the _General\n",
      "Chronicle_, interests us as being the fountain-head of those _romances_\n",
      "on the Cid whose collection we owe to that enthusiastic and most\n",
      "learned investigator, Madame Carolina MichaÃ«lis de Vasconcellos. Far\n",
      "inferior in merit and interest to the _Poema_, the _Rodrigo_ ranks with\n",

      "hampered by his lack of imagination, by the poverty of his conditions,\n",
      "by the absence of models, by the narrow circle of his subjects, and by\n",

      "amid his long digressions into prosy theological commonplace there\n",

      "Sainte Vierge_, by the French _trouvÃ¨re_, Gautier de Coinci, Prior of\n",
      "Vic-sur-Aisne (1177-1236). Certain it is that Gautier's source, the\n",

      "de Beauvais' _Speculum historiale_ and Pothon's _Liber de miraculis\n",
      "SanctÃ¦ Dei Genitricis MariÃ¦_âwhich both Berceo and Alfonso used. But\n",
      "since Alfonso, a middle-aged man when Berceo died, knew the Soissons\n",
      "collection, it seems possible that Berceo also handled it. A close\n",
      "examination of his text converts the bare possibility into something\n",
      "approaching certainty. Of Berceo's twenty-five Marian legends, eighteen\n",
      "are given by Gautier de Coinci, whose total reaches fifty-five. This\n",
      "is not by itself final, for both writers might have selected them from\n",
      "a common source. Yet there are convincing proofs of imitation in the\n",
      "coincidences of thought and expression which are apparent in Gautier\n",
      "and Berceo. These are too numerous to be accidental; and still more\n",
      "weight must be given to the fact that in several cases where Gautier\n",
      "invents a detail of his own wit, Berceo reproduces it. Taken in\n",
      "conjunction with his known habit of strict adherence to his text, it\n",
      "follows that Berceo took Gautier for his guide. He did what all the\n",
      "world was doing in borrowing from the French, and in the _Virgin's\n",
      "Lament_ he has the candour to confess the northern supremacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, it would be wrong to think that Berceo contents himself with\n",
      "mere servile reproduction, or that he trespasses in the manner of\n",
      "a vulgar plagiary. Seven of his legends he seeks elsewhere than in\n",
      "Gautier, and he takes it upon himself to condense his predecessor's\n",
      "diffuse narration. Thus, where Gautier needs 1350 lines to tell the\n",
      "legend of St. Ildefonsus, or 2090 to give the miracle of Theophilus,\n",
      "Berceo confines himself to 108 and to 657 lines. Gautier will spare\n",
      "you no detail; he will have you know the why, the when, the how, the\n",
      "paltriest circumstance of his pious story. Beside him Berceo shines by\n",
      "his power of selection, by his finer instinct for the essential, by\n",
      "his relative sobriety of tone, by his realistic eye, by his variety of\n",
      "resource in pure Castilian expression, by his richer melody, and by the\n",
      "fleeter movement of his action. In a word, with all his imperfections,\n",
      "Berceo approves himself the sounder craftsman of the two, and therefore\n",
      "he finds thirty readers where the Prior of Vic-sur-Aisne finds one.\n",
      "Small and few as his opportunities were, he rarely failed to use\n",
      "them to an advantage; as in the invention of the singular rhymed\n",
      "octosyllabic songâwith its haunting refrain, _Eya velar!_âin the\n",
      "_Virgin's Lament_ (stanzas 170-198). This argues a considerable lyrical\n",
      "gift, and the pity is that the most of Berceo's editors should have\n",
      "been at such pains to hide it from the reader.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the ten thousand lines of the _Libro de Alexandre_ are recounted\n",
      "the imaginary adventures of the Macedonian king, as told in Gautier\n",
      "de Lille's _Alexandreis_ and in the versions of Lambert de Tort and\n",
      "Alexandre de Bernai. Traces of the Leonese dialect negative the\n",
      "ascription to Berceo, and the Juan Lorenzo Segura de Astorga mentioned\n",
      "in the last verses is a mere copyist. The _Poema de FernÃ¡n GonzÃ¡lez_,\n",
      "due to a monk of San Pedro de Arlanza, embodies many picturesque and\n",
      "primitive legends in Berceo's manner. But the value of both these\n",
      "compositions is slight.\n",
      "\n",
      "So much for verse. Castilian prose develops on parallel lines with\n",
      "it. A very early specimen is the didactic treatise called the _Diez\n",
      "Mandamientos_, written by a Navarrese monk, at the beginning of the\n",
      "thirteenth century, for the use of confessors. Somewhat later follow\n",
      "the _Anales Toledanos_, in two separate parts (the third is much more\n",
      "recent), composed between the years 1220 and 1250. Rodrigo JimÃ©nez\n",
      "de Rada, Archbishop of Toledo (1170-1247), wrote a Latin _Historia\n",
      "Gothica_, which begins with the Gothic invasion, and ends at the year\n",
      "1243. Undertaken at the bidding of St. Ferdinand of Castile, this work\n",
      "was summarised, and done into Castilian, probably by JimÃ©nez de Rada\n",
      "himself, under the title of the _Historia de los Godos_. Its date would\n",
      "be the fourth decade of the thirteenth century, and to this same time\n",
      "(1241) belongs the _Fuero Juzgo_ (_Forum Judicum_). This is a Castilian\n",

      "origin, given by St. Ferdinand (1200-1252) to the Spaniards settled in\n",
      "CÃ³rdoba and other southern cities after the reconquest; but though of\n",
      "extreme value to the philologer, its literary interest is too slight to\n",
      "detain us here. Two most brilliant specimens of early Spanish prose\n",
      "are the letters supposed to have been written by the dying Alexander\n",
      "to his mother; and the accident of their being found in the manuscript\n",
      "copied by Lorenzo Segura de Astorga has led to their being printed at\n",
      "the end of the _Libro de Alexandre_. There is good reason for thinking\n",
      "that they are not by the author of that poem; and, in truth, they\n",
      "are mere translations. Both letters are taken from _Hunain ibn IshÄk\n",
      "al-'IbÄdÄ«'s_ Arabic collection of moral sentences; the first is found\n",
      "in the _Bonium_ (so called from its author, a mythical King of Persia),\n",
      "and the second on the Castilian version of the _Secretum Secretorum_,\n",
      "of which the very title is reproduced as _Poridat de las Poridades_.\n",
      "Further examples of progressive prose are found in the _Libro de los\n",
      "doce Sabios_, which deals with the political education of princes,\n",
      "and may have been drawn up by the direction of St. Ferdinand. But\n",
      "the authorship and date of these compilations are little better than\n",
      "conjectural.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the preliminary essays in the stuff of Spanish prose. Its\n",
      "permanent form was received at the hands of ALFONSO THE LEARNED\n",
      "(1226-84), who followed his father, St. Ferdinand, to the Castilian\n",
      "throne in 1252. Unlucky in his life, balked of his ambition to wear the\n",
      "title of Emperor, at war with Popes, his own brothers, his children,\n",
      "and his people, Alfonso has been hardly entreated after death.\n",
      "Mariana, the greatest of Spanish historians, condenses the vulgar\n",
      "verdict in a Tacitean phrase: _Dum cÅlum considerat terra amissit_.\n",
      "A mountain of libellous myth has overlaid Alfonso's fame. Of all the\n",
      "anecdotes concerning him, the best known is that which reports him\n",
      "as saying, \"Had God consulted me at the creation of the world, He\n",
      "would have made it differently.\" This deliberate invention is due\n",
      "to Pedro IV. (the Ceremonious); and if Pedro foresaw the result,\n",
      "he must have been a scoundrel of genius. Fortunately, nothing can\n",
      "rob Alfonso of his right to be considered, not only as the father of\n",
      "Castilian verse, but as the centre of all Spanish intellectual life.\n",
      "Political disaster never caused his intellectual activity to slacken.\n",
      "Like Bacon, he took all knowledge for his province, and in every\n",
      "department he shone pre-eminent. Astronomy, music, philosophy, canon\n",
      "and civil law, history, poetry, the study of languages: he forced his\n",
      "people upon these untrodden roads. To catalogue the series of his\n",
      "scientific enterprises, and to set down the names of his Jewish and\n",
      "Arab collaborators, would give ample work to a bibliographer. Both the\n",
      "_Tablas Alfonsis_ and the colossal _Libros del Saber de AstronomÃ­a_\n",
      "(Books on the Science of Astronomy) are packed with minute corrections\n",
      "of Ptolemy, in whose system the learned King seems to have suspected\n",
      "an error; but their present interest lies in the historic fact, that\n",
      "with their compilation Castilian makes its first great stride in the\n",
      "direction of exactitude and clearness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar qualities of precision and ease were developed in encyclopÃ¦dic\n",
      "treatises like the _Septenario_[3] which, together with the _Fuero\n",
      "Juzgo_, Alfonso drew up in his father's lifetime; and in practical\n",
      "guides such as the _Juegos de AÃ§edrex, Dados, et Tablas_ (Book of\n",
      "Chess, Dice, and Chequers). This miraculous activity astounded\n",
      "contemporaries, and posterity has multiplied the wonder by attributing\n",
      "well-nigh every possible anonymous work to the man whose real activity\n",
      "is a marvel. It has been sought to prove him the author of the _Libro\n",
      "de Alexandre_, the writer of Alexander's _Letters_, the compiler of\n",
      "treatises on the chase, the translator of _Kalilah and Dimnah_, and\n",
      "innumerable more pieces. Not one of these can be brought home to him,\n",
      "and some belong to a later time. Ticknor, again, foists on Alfonso two\n",
      "separate works each entitled the _Tesoro_, and the authorship has been\n",
      "accepted upon that authority. It is therefore necessary to state the\n",
      "real case. The one _Tesoro_ is a prose translation of Brunetto Latini's\n",
      "_Li Livres dou TrÃ©sor_ made by Alfonso de Paredes and Pero GÃ³mez,\n",
      "respectively surgeon and secretary at the court of Sancho, Alfonso's\n",
      "son and successor; the other _Tesoro_, with its prose preamble and\n",
      "forty-eight stanzas, is a forgery vamped by some parasite in the train\n",
      "of Alonso Carrillo, Archbishop of Toledo, during the fifteenth century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alonso de Fuentes, writing three hundred years after Alfonso's death,\n",
      "names him as author of a celebrated _romance_â\"_I left behind my\n",
      "native land_\"; the rhythm and accentuation prove the lines to belong\n",
      "to a fifteenth-century maker whose attribution of them to the King is\n",
      "palpably dramatic. Great authorities accept as authentic the _Libro de\n",
      "Querellas_ (Book of Plaints), which is represented by two fine stanzas\n",
      "addressed to Diego Sarmiento, \"brother and friend and vassal leal\" of\n",
      "\"him whose foot was kissed by kings, him from whom queens sought alms\n",
      "and grace.\" One is sorry to lose them, but they must be rejected. No\n",
      "such book is known to any contemporary; the twelve-syllabled octave in\n",
      "which the stanzas are written was not invented till a hundred years\n",
      "later; and these two stanzas are simply fabrications by Pellicer, who\n",
      "first published them in the seventeenth century in his _Memoir on the\n",
      "House of Sarmiento_, with a view to flattering his patron.\n",
      "\n",
      "This to some extent clears the ground: but not altogether. Setting\n",
      "aside minor legal and philosophic treatises which Alfonso may have\n",
      "supervised, it remains to speak of more important matters. A great\n",
      "achievement is the code called, from the number of its divisions, the\n",
      "_Siete Partidas_ (Seven Parts). This name does not appear to have been\n",
      "attached to the code till a hundred years after its compilation; but it\n",
      "may be worth observing that the notion is implied in the name of the\n",
      "_Septenario_, and that Alfonso, regarding the number seven as something\n",
      "of mysterious potency, exhausts himself in citing precedentsâthe seven\n",
      "days of the week, seven metals, seven arts, seven years that Jacob\n",
      "served, seven lean years in Egypt, the seven-branched candlestick,\n",
      "seven sacraments, and so on. The trait is characteristic of the time.\n",
      "It would be a grave mistake to suppose that the _Siete Partidas_ in\n",
      "any way resembles a modern book of statutes, couched in the technical\n",
      "jargon of the law. Its primary object was the unification of the\n",
      "various clashing systems of law which Alfonso encountered within his\n",
      "unsettled kingdom; and this he accomplished with such success that all\n",
      "subsequent Spanish legislation derives from the _Siete Partidas_, which\n",
      "are still to some extent in force in the republican states of Florida\n",
      "and Louisiana. But the design soon outgrows mere practical purpose,\n",
      "and expands into dissertations upon general principles and the pettier\n",
      "details of conduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sancho Panza, as Governor of Barataria, could not have bettered the\n",
      "counsels of the _Siete Partidas_, whose very titles force a smile:\n",
      "\"What things men should blush to confess, and what _not_,\" \"Why\n",
      "no monk should study law or physics,\" \"Why the King should abstain\n",
      "from low talk,\" \"Why the King should eat and drink moderately,\" \"Why\n",
      "the King's children should be taught to be cleanly,\" \"How to draw\n",
      "a will so that the witnesses shall not know its tenor,\" with other\n",
      "less prudish discussions. The reading of this code is not merely\n",
      "instructive and curious; apart from its dry humouristic savour, the\n",
      "_Siete Partidas_ rises to a noble eloquence when the subject is the\n",
      "common weal, the office of the ruler, his relations to his people, and\n",
      "the interdependence of Church and State. No man, by his single effort,\n",
      "could draw a code of such intricacy and breadth, and it is established\n",
      "that Jacobo Ruiz and FernÃ¡n MartÃ­nez laboured on it; but Alfonso's is\n",
      "the supreme intelligence which appoints and governs, and his is the\n",
      "revising hand which leaves the text in its perfect verbal form.\n",
      "\n",
      "In history, too, Alfonso sought distinction; and he found it. The\n",
      "_CrÃ³nica_ or _Estoria de Espanna_, composed between the years 1260 and\n",
      "1268, the _General e grand Estoria_, begun in 1270, owe to him their\n",
      "inspiration. The latter, ranging from the Creation to Apostolic times,\n",
      "glances at such secular events as the Babylonian Empire and the fall\n",
      "of Troy; the former extends from the peopling of Europe by the sons of\n",
      "Japhet to the death of St. Ferdinand. Rodrigo JimÃ©nez de Rada and Lucas\n",
      "de Tuy are the direct authorities, and their testimonies are completed\n",
      "by elaborate references that stretch from Pliny to the _cantares de\n",
      "gesta_. Moreover, the Arab chronicles are avowedly utilised in the\n",
      "account of the Cid's exploits: \"thus says Abenfarax in his Arabic\n",
      "whence this history is derived.\" A singular circumstance is the\n",
      "inferiority of style in these renderings from the Arabic. Elsewhere\n",
      "a strange ignorance of Arabs and their history is shown by the\n",
      "compiler's inclusion of such fables as Muhammad's crusade in CÃ³rdoba.\n",
      "The inevitable conclusion is that the _Estorias_, like the _Siete\n",
      "Partidas_, are compilations by several hands; and the idea is supported\n",
      "by the fact that the prologue to the _Estoria de Espanna_ is scarcely\n",
      "more than a translation of JimÃ©nez de Rada's preface.\n",
      "\n",

      "CÃ³rdoba, Suero PÃ©rez, Bishop of Zamora, and Garci FernÃ¡ndez de Toledo;\n",
      "and even though these attributions be (as seems likely) a trifle\n",

      "timor Domini._\" St. John, Job, Cato, St. Gregory, the Decretalsâhe\n",

      "by the rules of the _mester de clerecÃ­a_; but he handles it with a\n",
      "freedom unknown before, imparts to it a new flexibility, a variety, a\n",
      "speed, a music beyond all precedent, and transfuses it with a humour\n",
      "which anticipates Cervantes. Nay, he does more. In his prose preface he\n",
      "asserts that he chiefly sought to give examples of prosody, of rhyme\n",
      "and composition:â\"_Dar algunas lecciones, Ã© muestra de versificar,\n",

      "his observation of manners, and his lyrical endowment. The name of \"the\n",
      "Spanish Petronius\" has been given to him; yet, despite a superficial\n",

      "years the _serranillas_ and the _vaqueiras_ of Santillana, and entitle\n",

      "had a Legend of Women; but his reading was his own, and Chaucer's\n",
      "adjective cannot be applied to it. His ambition is, not to idealise,\n",
      "but to realise existence, and he interprets its sensuous animalism in\n",
      "the spirit of picaresque enjoyment. Jewesses, Moorish dancers, the\n",
      "procuress _Trota-conventos_, her finicking customers, the loose nuns,\n",

      "narrow limits does Ayala deal with courts and courtiers; he had a wider\n",
      "outlook, and he scourges society at large. What was a jest to Ruiz was\n",
      "a woe to the Chancellor. Ruiz had a natural sympathy for a loose-living\n",
      "cleric; Ayala lashes this sort with a thong steeped in vitriol. The\n",
      "one looks at life as a farce; the other sees it as a tragedy. Where\n",
      "the first finds matter for merriment, the second burns with the white\n",
      "indignation of the just. The deliberate mordancy of Ayala is impartial\n",
      "insomuch as it is universal. Courtiers, statesmen, bishops, lawyers,\n",
      "merchantsâhe brands them all with corruption, simony, embezzlement,\n",
      "and exposes them as venal sons of Belial. And, like Ruiz, he places\n",
      "himself in the pillory to heighten his effects. He spares not his\n",
      "superstitious belief in omens, dreams, and such-like fooleries; he\n",

      "range of ideas: his attraction lies not so much in what is said as in\n",
      "his trick of saying it. He is one of the few poets whom erudition has\n",
      "not hampered. He was familiar with writers as diverse as Dante and\n",
      "Petrarch and Alain Chartier, and he reproduces their characteristics\n",
      "with a fine exactness and felicity. But he was something more than\n",
      "an intelligent echo, for he filed and laboured till he acquired a\n",
      "final manner of his own. Doubtless to his own taste his forty-two\n",
      "sonnetsâ_fechos al itÃ¡lico modo_, as he proudly tells you were his\n",
      "best titles to glory; and it is true that he acclimatised the sonnet\n",

      "of being Spain's only sonneteer before BoscÃ¡n's time. Commonplace\n",
      "in thought, stiff in expression, the sonnets are only historically\n",
      "curious. It is in his lighter vein that Santillana reaches his full\n",
      "stature. The grace and gaiety of his _decires_, _serranillas_ and\n",
      "_vaqueiras_ are all his own. If he borrowed suggestions from ProvenÃ§al\n",
      "poets, he is free of the ProvenÃ§al artifice, and sings with the\n",
      "simplicity of Venus' doves. Here he revealed a peculiar aspect of\n",
      "his many-sided temperament, and by his tact made a living thing of\n",
      "primitive emotions, which were to be done to death in the pastorals of\n",
      "heavy-handed bunglers. The first-fruits of the pastoral harvest live in\n",

      "The official court-poet of the age was JUAN DE MENA (1411-56), known to\n",
      "his own generation as the \"prince of Castilian poets,\" and Cervantes,\n",
      "writing more than a hundred and fifty years afterwards, dubs him\n",
      "\"that great CÃ³rdoban poet.\" A true son of CÃ³rdoba, Mena has all the\n",
      "qualities of the CÃ³rdoban schoolâthe ostentatious embellishment\n",
      "of his ancestor, Lucan, and the unintelligible preciosity of his\n",
      "descendant, GÃ³ngora. The Italian travels of his youth undid him,\n",
      "and set him on the hopeless line of Italianising Spanish prose. A\n",
      "false attribution enters the Annals of Juan II. under Mena's name:\n",
      "the mere fact that Juan II.'s _CrÃ³nica_ is a model of correct prose\n",
      "disposes of the pretension. Mena's summary of the _Iliad_, and the\n",
      "commentary to his poem the _CoronaciÃ³n_, convict him of being the\n",
      "worst prose-writer in all Castilian literature. Simplicity and\n",
      "vulgarity were for him synonyms, and he carries his doctrine to its\n",
      "logical extreme by adopting impossible constructions, by wrenching\n",
      "his sentences asunder by exaggerated inversions, and by adding absurd\n",
      "Latinisms to his vocabulary. These defects are less grave in his verse,\n",
      "but even there they follow him. Argote de Molina would have him the\n",
      "author of the political satire called the _Coplas de la Panadera_;\n",
      "but Mena lacked the lightness of touch, the wit and sparkle of the\n",
      "imaginary baker's wife. If he be read at all, he is to be studied in\n",
      "his _Laberinto_, also known as the _Trescientas_, a heavy allegory\n",
      "whose deliberate obscurity is indicated by its name. The alternative\n",
      "title, _Trescientas_; is explained by the fact that the poem consisted\n",
      "of three hundred stanzas, to which sixty-five were added by request of\n",
      "the King, who kept the book by him of nights and hankered for a stanza\n",
      "daily, using it, maybe, as a soporific. The poet is whisked by the\n",
      "dragons in Bellona's chariot to Fortune's palace, and there begins the\n",
      "inevitable imitation of Dante, with its machinery of seven planetary\n",
      "circles, and its grandiose vision of past, present, and future. The\n",
      "work of a learned poet taking himself too seriously and straining after\n",
      "effects beyond his reach, the _Laberinto_ is tedious as a whole; yet,\n",
      "though Mena's imagination fails to realise his abstractions, though\n",
      "he be riddled with purposeless conceits, he touches a high level in\n",
      "isolated episodes. Much of his vogue may be accounted for by the\n",
      "abundance with which he throws off striking lines of somewhat hard,\n",
      "even marmoreal beauty, and by the ardent patriotism which inspires\n",
      "him in his best passages. A poet by flashes, at intervals rare and far\n",
      "apart, Mena does himself injustice by too close a devotion to Ã¦sthetic\n",

      "that Torres Naharro, having taken orders, was captured by Algerine\n",
      "pirates, was ransomed, and made his way to Rome about the year 1513.\n",
      "Further, we know that he lived at Naples in the service of Fabrizio\n",
      "Colonna, and that his collected plays were published at Naples in\n",
      "1517 with the title of _Propaladia_, dedicated to Francisco DÃ¡valos,\n",
      "the Spanish husband of Vittoria Colonna. That Torres Naharro was a\n",
      "favourite with Leo X. rests on no better basis than the fact that in\n",
      "the Pope's privilege to print he is styled _dilectus filius_.\n",
      "\n",
      "His friendly witness, Barbier, informs us that, though Torres Naharro\n",
      "was quite competent to write his plays in Latin, he chose Castilian of\n",
      "set purpose that \"he might be the first to write in the vulgar tongue.\"\n",
      "This phrase, taken by itself, implies ignorance of Encina's work; in\n",
      "any case, Torres Naharro develops his drama on a larger scale than that\n",
      "of his predecessor. His _Prohemio_ or Preface is full of interesting\n",
      "doctrine. He divides his plays into five acts, because Horace wills it\n",
      "so, and these acts he calls _jornadas_, \"because they resemble so many\n",
      "resting-points.\" The personages should not be too many: not less than\n",
      "six, and not more than twelve. If the writer introduces some twenty\n",
      "characters in his _Tinellaria_, he excuses himself on the ground that\n",
      "\"the subject needed it.\" He further apologises for the introduction\n",
      "of Italian words in his plays: a concession to \"the place where, and\n",
      "the persons to whom, the plays were recited.\" Lastly, Torres Naharro\n",
      "divides dramas into two broad classes: first, the _comedia de noticia_,\n",
      "which treats of events really seen and noted; second, the _comedia de\n",
      "fantasÃ­a_, which deals with feigned things, imaginary incidents that\n",
      "seem true, and might be true, though in fact they are not so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the _comedia de fantasÃ­a_ Torres Naharro is the earliest master. He\n",
      "adventures on the allegorical drama in his _Trofea_, which commemorates\n",
      "the exploits of Manoel of Portugal in Africa and India, and brings Fame\n",
      "and Apollo upon the stage. The chivalresque drama is represented by\n",
      "him in such pieces as the _Serafina_, the _Aquilana_, the _Himenea_;\n",
      "while he examples the play of manners by the _Jacinta_ and the\n",
      "_Soldadesca_. Each piece begins with an _introyto_ or prologue, wherein\n",
      "indulgence and attention are requested; then follows a concise summary\n",
      "of the plot; last, the action opens. The faults of Torres Naharro's\n",
      "theatre are patent enough: his tendency to turn comedy to farce, his\n",
      "inclination to extravagance, his want of tact in crowding his stageâas\n",
      "in the _Tinellaria_âwith half-a-dozen characters chattering in\n",
      "half-a-dozen different languages at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting aside these primitive humours, it is impossible to deny that\n",
      "Torres Naharro has a positive, as well as an historic value. His\n",
      "versification, always in the Castilian octosyllabic metre, with no\n",
      "trespassing on the Italian hendecasyllabic, is neat and polished,\n",
      "and, though far from splendid, lacks neither sweetness nor speed; his\n",
      "dialogue is pointed, opportune, dramatic; his characters are observed\n",
      "and are set in the proper light. His verses entitled the _Lamentaciones\n",
      "de Amor_ are in the old, artificial manner; his satirical couplets\n",
      "on the clergy are vigorous and witty attacks on the general life of\n",
      "Rome; his devout songs are neither better nor worse than those of his\n",
      "contemporaries; and his sonnetsâtwo in Italian, one in a mixture of\n",
      "Italian and Latinâare mere curiosities of no real worth, yet they\n",
      "testify to the writer's uncommon versatility. Versatile Torres Naharro\n",
      "unquestionably was, and his gift serves him in the plays for which he\n",
      "is remembered. He is the first Spaniard to realise his personages, to\n",
      "create character on the boards; the first to build a plot, to maintain\n",
      "an interest of action by variety of incident, to polish an intrigue, to\n",
      "concentrate his powers within manageable limits, to view stage-effects\n",
      "from before the curtain. In a word, Torres Naharro knew the stage,\n",
      "its possibilities, and its resources. For his own age and for his\n",
      "opportunities he knew it even too well; and his _Himenea_âthe theme\n",
      "of which is the love of Himeneo for Febea, with the interposition of\n",
      "Febea's brother, petulant as to the \"point of honour\"âis an isolated\n",
      "masterpiece, unrivalled till the time of Lope de Vega. The accident\n",
      "that Torres Naharro's _Propaladia_ was printed in Italy; the misfortune\n",
      "that its Spanish reprints were tardy, and that his plays were too\n",
      "complicated for the primitive resources of the Spanish stage: these\n",
      "delayed the development of the Spanish theatre by close on a century.\n",
      "Yet the fact remains: to find a match for the _Himenea_ we must pass to\n",
      "the best of Lope's pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the Spaniard in Italy. In Portugal, likewise, he made his way. GIL\n",
      "VICENTE (1470-1540), the Portuguese dramatist, wrote forty-two pieces,\n",

      "as _aravia_ in his _Auto das Fadas_. An important historical fact is\n",

      "is in Castilian, and that it was actually playedâthe first lay piece\n",
      "ever given in Portugalâon June 8, 1502. Its simplicity of tone and\n",
      "elegance of manner are reminiscent of Encina, and it can scarce be\n",
      "doubted that Vicente's imitation is deliberate. Still more obvious\n",
      "is the following of Encina's eclogues in Vicente's _Auto pastoril\n",
      "Castelhano_ and the _Auto dos Reis Magos_, where the legend is treated\n",
      "with Encina's curious touch of devotion and modernity, the whole\n",
      "closing with a song in which all join. Once again Encina's influence\n",
      "is manifest in the _Auto da Sibilla Cassandra_, wherein Cassandra,\n",
      "niece of Moses, Abraham, and Isaiah, is wooed by Solomon. In _AmadÃ­s de\n",
      "Gaula_ and in _Dom Duardos_ there is a marked advance in elaboration\n",
      "and finish; and in the _Auto da FÃ©_ Vicente proves his independence by\n",
      "an ingenuity and a fancy all his own. Here he displays qualities above\n",
      "those of his model, and treats his subject with such brilliancy that,\n",
      "a century and a half later, CalderÃ³n condescended to borrow from the\n",
      "Portuguese the idea of his _auto_ entitled _El Lirio y la Azucena_. Gil\n",
      "Vicente is technically a dramatist, but he is not dramatic as Torres\n",
      "Naharro is dramatic. His action is slight, his treatment timid and\n",
      "conventional, and he is more poetic than inventive; still, his dramatic\n",

      "unapproached by those who went before him, and surpassed by few who\n",

      "in the year 1526, Navagiero met BoscÃ¡n, who has left us an account\n",
      "of the conversation:â\"Talking of wit and letters, especially of\n",
      "their varieties in different tongues, he inquired why I did not try\n",
      "in Castilian the sonnets and verse-forms favoured by distinguished\n",
      "Italians. He not only suggested this, but pressed me urgently to the\n",
      "attempt. Some days later, I made for home, and, because of the length\n",
      "and loneliness of the journey, thinking matters over, I returned to\n",
      "what Navagiero had said, and thus I first attempted this sort of verse;\n",
      "finding it hard at the outset, since it is very intricate, with many\n",
      "peculiarities, varying greatly from ours. Yet, later, I fancied that I\n",
      "was progressing well, perhaps because we all love our own essays; hence\n",
      "I continued, little by little, with increasing zeal.\" This passage is\n",
      "a _locus classicus_. Ticknor justly observes that no single foreigner\n",
      "ever affected a national literature more deeply and more instantly\n",
      "than Navagiero, and that we have here a first-hand account, probably\n",
      "unique in literary history, of the first inception of a revolution by\n",
      "the earliest, if not the most conspicuous, actor in it. We have at\n",
      "last reached the parting of the ways, and BoscÃ¡n presents himself as\n",
      "a guide to the Promised Land. The astonishing thing is that BoscÃ¡n, a\n",
      "Barcelonese by birth and residence, ignores AuzÃ­as March.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were many Italianates before BoscÃ¡nâas Francisco Imperial and\n",
      "Santillana; but their hour was not propitious, and BoscÃ¡n is with\n",
      "justice regarded as the leader of the movement. He was not a poet of\n",
      "singular gifts, and he had the disadvantage of writing in Castilian,\n",
      "which was not his native language; but BoscÃ¡n had the wit to see\n",
      "that Castilian was destined to supremacy, and he mastered it for his\n",
      "purpose with that same dogged perseverance which led him to undertake\n",
      "his more ambitious attempt unaided. He does not, indeed, appear to\n",
      "have sought for disciples, nor were his own efforts as successful\n",
      "as he believed: \"perhaps because we all love our own essays.\" His\n",
      "Castilian prose is evidence of his gift of style, and his translation\n",
      "of Castiglione's _Cortegiano_ is a triumph of rendering fit to take\n",
      "its place beside our Thomas Hoby's version of the same original. But,\n",
      "it must be said frankly, that BoscÃ¡n's most absolute success is in\n",
      "prose. Herrera bitterly taunts him with decking himself in the precious\n",
      "robes of Petrarch, and with remaining, spite of all that he can do, \"a\n",
      "foreigner in his language.\" And the charge is true. In verse BoscÃ¡n's\n",
      "defects grow very visible: his hardness, his awkward construction, his\n",
      "unrefined ear, his uncertain touch upon his instrument, his boisterous\n",
      "execution. Still, it is not as an original genius that BoscÃ¡n finds\n",
      "place in history, but rather as an initiator, a master-opportunist\n",
      "who, without persuasion, by the sheer force of conviction and example,\n",
      "led a nation to abandon the ancient ways, and to admit the potency and\n",
      "charm of exotic forms. That in itself constitutes a title, if not to\n",
      "immortality, at least to remembrance.\n",
      "\n",
      "BoscÃ¡n's influence manifested itself in diverse ways. His friend,\n",
      "Garcilaso de la Vega, sent him the first edition of Castiglione's\n",
      "_Cortegiano_, printed at Venice in 1528. Thisâ\"the best book that\n",
      "ever was written upon good breeding,\" according to Samuel Johnsonâwas\n",
      "triumphantly translated into Castilian by BoscÃ¡n at Garcilaso's prayer;\n",
      "and, though BoscÃ¡n himself held translation to be a thing meet for\n",
      "\"men of small parts,\" his rendering is an almost perfect performance.\n",
      "Moreover, it was the single work published by him (1534), for his poems\n",
      "appeared under his widow's care. Once more, in an epistle directed\n",
      "to Hurtado de Mendoza, BoscÃ¡n re-echoes Horace's note of elegant\n",
      "simplicity with a faithfulness not frequent in his work; and, lastly,\n",
      "it is known that he did into Castilian an Euripidean play, which,\n",
      "though licensed for the press, was never printed. Truly it seems that\n",
      "BoscÃ¡n was conscious of his very definite limitations, and that he\n",
      "felt the necessity of a copy, rather than a direct model. If it were\n",
      "so, this would indicate a power of conscious selection, a faculty\n",
      "for self-criticism which cannot be traced in his published verses.\n",
      "His earlier poems, written in Castilian measures, show him for a\n",
      "man destitute of guidance, thrown on his own resources, a perfectly\n",
      "undistinguished versifier with naught to sing and with no dexterity of\n",
      "vocalisation. Yet, let BoscÃ¡n betake himself to the poets of the Cinque\n",
      "Cento, and he flashes forth another being: the dauntless adventurer\n",
      "sailing for unknown continents, inspired by the enthusiasm of immediate\n",
      "suggestion.\n",
      "\n",
      "His _Hero y Leandra_ is frankly based upon MusÃ¦us, and it is\n",
      "characteristic of BoscÃ¡n's mode that he expands MusÃ¦us' three hundred\n",
      "odd hexameters into nigh three thousand hendecasyllabics. Professor\n",
      "Flamini has demonstrated most convincingly that BoscÃ¡n followed Tasso's\n",
      "_Favola_, but he comes far short of Tasso's variety, distinction, and\n",
      "grace. He annexes the Italian blank verseâthe _versi sciolti_âas it\n",
      "were by sheer force, but he never subdues the metre to his will, and\n",
      "his monotony of accent and mechanical cadence grow insufferable. Not\n",
      "only so: too often the very pretence of inspiration dissolves, and the\n",
      "writer descends upon slothful prose, sliced into lines of regulation\n",
      "length, honeycombed with flat colloquialisms. Conspicuously better is\n",
      "the _Octava Rima_âan allegory embodying the Court of Love and the\n",
      "Court of Jealousy, with the account of an embassage from the former to\n",
      "two fair Barcelonese rebels. Of this performance Thomas Stanley has\n",
      "given an English version (1652) from which these stanzas are taken:â\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"_In the bright region of the fertile east\n",

      "  By no unwelcome discontent opprest,\n",
      "    No cares save those that from this passion flow,\n",

      "  The beauteous Queen sprung from the foaming main._\n",
      "\n",
      "  _Her hand the sceptre bears, the crown her head,\n",

      "works,\" and as to the correctness of the first adjective there can\n",
      "be no two opinions. But concerning BoscÃ¡n's originality there is much\n",
      "to say. Passage upon passage in the _Octava Rima_ is merely a literal\n",
      "rendering of Bembo's _Stanze_, and the translation begins undisguised\n",
      "at the opening line. Where the Italian writes, \"_Ne l'odorato e lucido\n",
      "Oriente_,\" the Spaniard follows him with the candid transcription, \"_En\n",
      "el lumbroso y fÃ©rtil Oriente_\"; and the imitation is further tesselated\n",
      "with mosaics conveyed from Claudian, from Petrarch, and Ariosto.\n",
      "None the less is it just to say that the conveyance is executed with\n",
      "considerableâalmost with masterlyâskill. The borrowing nowise\n",
      "belittles BoscÃ¡n; for he was notâdid not pose asâa great spirit\n",
      "with an original voice. He makes no claim whatever, he seeks for no\n",
      "applauseâthe shy, taciturn experimentalist who published never a line\n",
      "of verse, and piped for his own delight. Equipped with the ambition,\n",
      "though not with the accomplishment, of the artist, BoscÃ¡n has a prouder\n",
      "place than he ever dreamed of, since he is confessedly the earliest\n",
      "representative of a new poetic dynasty, the victorious leader of a\n",
      "desperately forlorn hope. That title is his laurel and his garland.\n",
      "He led his race into the untrodden ways, triumphing without effort\n",
      "where men of more strenuous faculty had failed; and his results have\n",
      "successfully challenged time, inasmuch as there has been no returning\n",
      "from his example during nigh four hundred years. Not a great genius,\n",
      "not a lordly versifier, endowed with not one supreme gift, BoscÃ¡n ranks\n",
      "as an unique instance in the annals of literary adventure by virtue of\n",
      "his enduring and irrevocable victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "His is the foremost post in point of time. In point of absolute merit\n",
      "he is easily outshone by his younger comrade, GARCILASO DE LA VEGA\n",
      "(1503-36), the bearer of a name renowned in Spanish chronicle and song.\n",
      "Grandson of PÃ©rez de GuzmÃ¡n, Garcilaso entered the Royal Body-guard in\n",
      "his eighteenth year. He quitted him like the man he was in crushing\n",
      "domestic rebellion, and, despite the fact that his brother, Pedro,\n",
      "served in the insurgent ranks, Garcilaso grew into favour with the\n",
      "Emperor.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Pavia, where Francis lost all save honour, Garcilaso distinguished\n",
      "himself by his intrepidity. For a moment he fell into disgrace\n",
      "because of his connivance at a secret marriage between his cousin\n",
      "and one of the Empress' Maids of Honour: interned in an islet on the\n",
      "Danube,â_Danubio, rio divino_, he calls it,âhe there composed one\n",
      "of his most admired pieces, richly charged with exotic colouring. His\n",
      "imprisonment soon ended, and, with intervals of service before Tunis,\n",
      "and with spells of embassies between Spain and Italy, his last years\n",
      "were mostly spent at Naples in the service of the Spanish Viceroy,\n",
      "Pedro de Toledo, MarquÃ©s de Villafranca, father of Garcilaso's friend,\n",
      "the Duque de Alba. In the ProvenÃ§al campaign the Spanish force was held\n",
      "in check by a handful of yeomen gathered in the fort of Muy, between\n",
      "Draguignan and FrÃ©jus. Muy recalls to Spanish hearts such memories\n",
      "as Zutphen brings to Englishmen. In itself the engagement was a mere\n",
      "skirmish: for Garcilaso it was a great and picturesque occasion. The\n",
      "accounts given by Navarrete and GarcÃ­a Cerezeda vary in detail, but\n",
      "their general drift is identical. The last of the Spanish CÃ¦sars named\n",
      "his personal favourite, the most dashing of Spanish soldiers and the\n",
      "most distinguished of Spanish poets, to command the storming-party.\n",
      "Doffing his breastplate and his helmet that he might be seen by all\n",
      "beholdersâby the Emperor not less than by the armyâGarcilaso led\n",

      "fell mortally wounded in the arms of JerÃ³nimo de Urrea, the future\n",
      "translator of Ariosto, and of his more intimate friend, the MarquÃ©s de\n",
      "Lombay, whom the world knows best as St. Francis Borgia. He was buried\n",
      "with his ancestors in his own Toledo, where, as even the grudging\n",
      "GÃ³ngora allows, every stone within the city is his monument.\n",
      "\n",
      "His illustrious descent, his ostentatious valour, his splendid\n",
      "presence, his seductive charm, his untimely death: all these, joined\n",
      "to his gift of song, combine to make him the hero of a legend and the\n",
      "idol of a nation. Like Sir Philip Sidney, Garcilaso personified all\n",
      "accomplishments and all graces. He died at thirty-three: the fact must\n",
      "be borne in mind when we take account of his life's work in literature.\n",
      "Yet Europe mourned for him, and the loyal BoscÃ¡n proclaimed his debt\n",
      "to the brilliant soldier-poet. Pleased as the Catalan was with his\n",
      "novel experiments, he avows he would not have persevered \"but for the\n",
      "encouragement of Garcilaso, whose decisionânot merely to my mind, but\n",
      "to the whole world'sâis to be taken as final. By praising my attempts,\n",
      "by showing the surest sign of approval through his acceptance of my\n",
      "example, he led me to dedicate myself wholly to the undertaking.\"\n",
      "BoscÃ¡n and Garcilaso were not divided by death. The former's widow, Ana\n",
      "GirÃ³n de Rebolledo, gave her husband's verses to the press in 1543;\n",
      "and, more jealous for the fame of her husband's friend than were any of\n",
      "his own household, she printed Garcilaso's poems in the Fourth Book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Garcilaso is eminently a poet of refinement, distinction, and\n",
      "cultivation. What BoscÃ¡n half knew, Garcilaso knew to perfection, and\n",
      "his accomplishment was wider as well as deeper.[6] Living his last\n",
      "years in Naples, Garcilaso had caught the right Renaissance spirit, and\n",
      "is beyond all question the most Italianate of Spanish poets in form\n",
      "and substance. He was not merely the associate of such expatriated\n",
      "countrymen as Juan de ValdÃ©s: he was the friend of Bembo and Tansillo,\n",
      "the first of whom calls him the best loved and the most welcome of\n",
      "all the Spaniards that ever came to Italy. To Tansillo, Garcilaso was\n",
      "attached by bonds of closest intimacy, and the reciprocal influence\n",
      "of the one upon the other is manifest in the works of both. This\n",
      "association would seem to have been the chief part of Garcilaso's\n",
      "literary training. His few flights in the old Castilian metres, his\n",
      "songs and _villancicos_, are of small importance; his finest efforts\n",
      "are cast in the exotic moulds. It is scarcely an exaggeration to say\n",
      "that fundamentally he is a Neapolitan poet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sum of his production is slight: the inconsiderable _villancicos_,\n",
      "three eclogues, two elegies, an epistle, five highly elaborated songs,\n",
      "and thirty-eight Petrarchan sonnets. Small as is his work in bulk,\n",
      "it cannot be denied that it was like nothing before it in Castilian.\n",
      "AuzÃ­as March, no doubt, had earlier struck a similar note in Catalan,\n",
      "and Garcilaso, who seems to have read everything, imitates his\n",
      "predecessor's harmonies and cadences. His trick of reminiscence is\n",
      "remarkable. Thus, his first eclogue is plainly suggested by Tansillo;\n",
      "his second eclogue is little more than a rendering in verse of picked\n",
      "passages from the _Arcadia_ of Jacopo Sannazaro; while the fifth of\n",
      "his songsâ_La Flor de Gnido_âis a most masterly transplantation of\n",
      "Bernardo Tasso's structure to Castilian soil. And almost every page is\n",
      "touched with the deliberate, conscious elegance of a student in the\n",
      "school of Horace. In simple execution Garcilaso is impeccable. The\n",
      "objection most commonly made is that he surrenders his personality, and\n",
      "converts himself into the exquisite echo of an exhausted pseudo-classic\n",
      "convention. And the charge is plausible.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is undeniably true that Garcilaso's distinction lacks the force\n",
      "of real simplicity, that his eternal sweetness cloys, and that the\n",
      "thing said absorbs him less than the manner of saying it. He would\n",
      "have met the criticism that he was an artificial poet by pointing\n",
      "out that, poetry being an art, it is of essence artificial. That he\n",
      "was an imitative artist was his highest glory: by imitating foreign\n",
      "models he attained his measure of originality, enriching Spain, with\n",
      "not merely a number of technical forms but a new poetic language.\n",
      "Without him BoscÃ¡n must have failed in his emprise, as Santillana\n",
      "failed before him. Besides his technical perfection, Garcilaso owned\n",
      "the poetic temperamentâa temperament too effeminately delicate for the\n",
      "vulgarities of life. As he tells us in his third eclogue, he lived,\n",
      "\"now using the sword, now the pen:\"â\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"_Tomando ora la espada, ora la pluma._\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the clank of the sabre is never heard in the fiery soldier's verse.\n",
      "His atmosphere is not that of battle, but is rather the enchanted haze\n",
      "of an Arcadia which never was nor ever could be in a banal world. As\n",
      "thus, in Wiffen's version:â\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"_Here ceased the youth his Doric madrigal,\n",
      "  And sighing, with his last laments let fall\n",

      "  Melodious from romantic steep to steep,\n",
      "  In mild responses deep;\n",
      "  Sweet Echo, starting from her couch of moss,\n",
      "  Lengthened the dirge; and tenderest Philomel,\n",

      "\n",
      "This is, in a sense, \"unnatural\"; but if we are to condemn it as such,\n",
      "we must even reject the whole school of pastoral, a convention of which\n",
      "the sixteenth century was enamoured. When Garcilaso introduced himself\n",
      "as Salicio, and, under the name of Nemoroso, presented BoscÃ¡n (or, as\n",
      "Herrera will have it, Antonio de Fonseca), he but took the formula as\n",
      "he found it, and translated it in terms of genius. He was consciously\n",
      "returning upon nature; not upon the material facts of existence as it\n",
      "is, but upon a figmentary nature idealised into a languid and ethereal\n",
      "beauty. He sought for effects of suavest harmony, embodying in his song\n",
      "a mystic neo-platonism, the _morbidezza_ of \"love in the abstract,\" set\n",
      "off by grace and sensibility and elfin music. It may be permissible\n",
      "for the detached critic to appreciate Garcilaso at something less than\n",
      "his secular renown, but this superior attitude were unlawful and\n",
      "inexpedient for an historical reviewer.\n",

      "Time and unanimity settle many questions: and, after all, on a\n",
      "matter concerning Castilian poetry, the unbroken verdict of the\n",
      "Castilian-speaking race must be accepted as weighty, if not final.\n",
      "Garcilaso may not be a supreme singer; he is at least one of the\n",
      "greatest of the Spanish poets. Choosing to reproduce the almost\n",
      "inimitable cadences of the Virgilian eclogue, he achieves his end with\n",
      "a dexterity that approaches genius. Others before him had hit upon\n",
      "what seemed \"pretty i' the Mantuan\": he alone suggests the secret\n",
      "of Virgil's brooding, incommunicable, and melancholy charm. What\n",
      "BoscÃ¡n saw to be possible, what he attempted with more good-will than\n",
      "fortune, that Garcilaso did with an instant and peremptory triumph.\n",
      "He naturalised the sonnet, he enlarged the framework of the song, he\n",
      "invented the ode, he so bravely arranged his lines of seven and eleven\n",
      "syllables that the fascination of his harmonies has led historians\n",
      "to forget Bernardo Tasso's priority in discovering the resources of\n",
      "the _lira_. In rare, unwary moments he lets fall an Italian or French\n",
      "idiom, nor is he always free from the pedantry of his time; but\n",

      "one who, writing in moments stolen from the rough life of camps, died\n",
      "at thirty-three, full of immense promise and immense possibilities. To\n",
      "speculate upon what Garcilaso might have become is vanity. As it is,\n",
      "he survives as the Prince of Italianates, the acknowledged master of\n",
      "the Cinque Cento form. Cervantes and Lope de Vega, agreed upon nothing\n",
      "else, are at one in holding him for the first of Castilian poets. With\n",
      "slight reservations, their judgment has been sustained, and even to-day\n",

      "have who, by the gift of God and by the benefit of Christ, have faith,\n",
      "hope, and charity, and so are pious, holy, and just in Christ.\" The\n",
      "Arian flavour of this work explains its non-appearance in Castilian,\n",
      "and we must suppose that Herbert esteemed it for its austere doctrinal\n",
      "asceticism rather than its crude anti-trinitarianism. A Quaker before\n",
      "his time, ValdÃ©s owes no small part of his recent vogue to Wiffen, who\n",

      "by a Spaniard, which represented essentially the principles of George\n",

      "In another and a less contested field, we owe to ValdÃ©s the admirable\n",

      "ValdÃ©s himself, and a Spanish soldier, called indifferently Pacheco\n",
      "and Torres. For all purposes this dialogue is as important a monument\n",
      "of literary criticism as was the conversation in Don Quixote's library\n",
      "between the Priest and the Barber. In almost every case posterity has\n",
      "ratified the personal verdict of ValdÃ©s, who approves himself the\n",

      "Spaniard may by mentioning Rueda in the same breath as Cervantes, and\n",
      "that the latter learned much from his predecessor is manifest; but the\n",

      "grasses. The Lord of the land roots out the weeds, sows seeds, and\n",
      "plants herbs and fruit-trees. The gardener must then care for them\n",
      "and water them, that they may thrive and blossom, and that the Lord\n",
      "may find pleasure in his garden and come to visit it. There are four\n",
      "ways in which the watering may be done. There is water which is drawn\n",
      "wearily by hand from the well. There is water drawn by the ox-wheel,\n",
      "more abundantly and with greater labour. There is water brought in\n",
      "from the river, which will saturate the whole ground; and, last and\n",
      "best, there is rain from heaven. Four sorts of prayer correspond to\n",
      "these. The first is a weary effort with small returns; the well may run\n",
      "dry: the gardener then must weep. The second is internal prayer and\n",
      "meditation upon God; the trees will then show leaves and flower-buds.\n",
      "The third is love of God. The virtues then become vigorous. We converse\n",
      "with God face to face. The flowers open and give out fragrance. The\n",
      "fourth kind cannot be described in words. Then there is no more toil,\n",
      "and the seasons no longer change; flowers are always blowing, and\n",
      "fruit ripens perennially. The soul enjoys undoubting certitude; the\n",
      "faculties work without effort and without consciousness; the heart\n",
      "loves and does not know that it loves; the mind perceives, yet does\n",
      "not know that it perceives. If the butterfly pauses to say to itself\n",
      "how prettily it is flying, the shining wings fall off, and it drops\n",

      "And, as Santa Teresa excelled in spiritual insight, so she has the\n",
      "sense of affairs. Durtal, in M. Joris-Karl Huysmans' _En Route_, first\n",
      "says of her:â\"Sainte TÃ©rÃ¨se a explorÃ© plus Ã  fond que tout autre\n",
      "les rÃ©gions inconnues de l'Ã¢me; elle en est, en quelque sorte, la\n",
      "gÃ©ographe; elle a surtout dressÃ© la carte de ses pÃ´les, marquÃ© les\n",
      "latitudes contemplatives, les terres intÃ©rieures du ciel humain.\"\n",
      "And he shows the reverse of the medal:â\"Mais quel singulier mÃ©lange\n",
      "elle montre aussi, d'une mystique ardente et d'une femme d'affaires\n",
      "froide; car, enfin, elle est Ã  double fond; elle est contemplative hors\n",
      "le monde et elle est Ã©galement un homme d'Ã©tat: elle est le Colbert\n",
      "fÃ©minin des cloÃ®tres.\" The key to Durtal's difficulties is given in\n",
      "the AbbÃ© GÃ©vresin's remark, that the perfect balance of good sense is\n",
      "one of the distinctive signs of the mystics. In Santa Teresa's case\n",
      "the sign is present. An uninquiring world may choose to think of her\n",
      "as a fanatic in vapours and in ecstasies. Yet it is she who writes,\n",
      "in the _Camino de PerfecciÃ³n_:â\"I would not have my daughters be, or\n",
      "seem to be, women in anything, but brave men.\" It is she who holds\n",
      "that \"of revelations no account should be made\"; who calls the usual\n",
      "convent life \"a shortcut to hell\"; who adds that \"if parents took my\n",
      "advice, they would rather marry their daughters to the poorest of\n",
      "men, or keep them at home under their own eyes.\" Her position as a\n",
      "spiritual force is as unique as her place in literature. It is certain\n",
      "that her \"own dear books\" were nothing to her; that she regarded\n",
      "literature as frivolity; and no one questions her right so to regard\n",
      "it. But the world also is entitled to its judgment, which is expressed\n",
      "in different ways. Jeremy Taylor cites her in a sermon preached at the\n",
      "opening of the Parliament of Ireland (May 8, 1661). Protestant England,\n",
      "by the mouth of Froude, compares Santa Teresa to Cervantes. Catholic\n",
      "Spain places her manuscript of her own _Life_ beside a page of St.\n",
      "Augustine's writing in the Palace of the Escorial.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some sense we may almost consider the Ecstatic Doctor, SAN JUAN DE\n",
      "LA CRUZ (1542-91), as one of Santa Teresa's disciples. He changed his\n",
      "worldly name of Juan de Yepes y Ãlvarez for that of Juan de la Cruz\n",
      "on joining the Carmelite order in 1563. Shortly afterwards he made\n",
      "the acquaintance of Santa Teresa, and, fired by her enthusiasm, he\n",
      "undertook to carry out in monasteries the reforms which she introduced\n",
      "in convents. In his _Obras espirituales_ (1618) mysticism finds its\n",
      "highest expression. There are moments when his prose style is of\n",
      "extreme clearness and force, but in many cases he soars to heights\n",
      "where the sense reels in the attempt to follow him. St. John of the\n",

      "is found at Madrid on December 19, 1580, and it is surmised that he\n",
      "served in Portugal and at the Azores. There are rumours of his holding\n",
      "some small post at Oran: however that may be, he returned to Spain, at\n",
      "latest, in the autumn of 1582. And henceforth he belongs to literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plays written at Algiers are lost; but there survive two sonnets\n",
      "of the same period dedicated to Rufino de ChamberÃ­ (1577). A rhymed\n",
      "epistle to the Secretary of State, Mateo VÃ¡zquez, also belongs to this\n",
      "time. We must suppose Cervantes to have written copiously on regaining\n",
      "his liberty, since GÃ¡lvez de Montalvo speaks of him as a poet of repute\n",
      "in the _Pastor de FÃ­lida_ (1582); but the earliest signs of him in\n",
      "Spain are his eulogistic sonnets in Padilla's _Romancero_ and Rufo\n",
      "GutiÃ©rrez' _Austriada_, both published in 1583. Padilla repaid the debt\n",
      "by classing the sonneteer among \"the most famous poets of Castile.\"\n",
      "In December 1584, Cervantes married Catalina de Palacios Salazar y\n",
      "Vozmediano, a native of Esquivias, eighteen years younger than himself.\n",
      "It is often said that he wrote the _Galatea_ as a means of furthering\n",
      "his suit. It may be so. But the book was not printed by Juan GraciÃ¡n\n",
      "of AlcalÃ¡ de Henares till March 1585, though the _aprobaciÃ³n_ and the\n",
      "privilege are dated February 1 and February 22, 1584. In the year after\n",
      "his marriage, Cervantes' illegitimate daughter, Isabel de Saavedra,\n",
      "was born. We shall have occasion to refer to her later. Our immediate\n",
      "concern is with the _Primera Parte de Galatea_, an unfinished pastoral\n",
      "novel in six books, for which Cervantes received 1336 _reales_ from\n",
      "Blas de Robles; a sum which, with his wife's small dowry, enabled him\n",
      "to start housekeeping.[17] As a financial speculation the _Galatea_\n",
      "failed: only two later editions appeared during the writer's lifetime,\n",
      "one at Lisbon in 1590, the other at Paris in 1611. Neither could have\n",
      "brought him money; but the book, if it did nothing else, served to make\n",
      "him known.\n",
      "\n",
      "He trimmed his sails to the popular breeze. MontemÃ´r had started\n",
      "the pastoral fashion, PÃ©rez and Gaspar Gil Polo had followed, and\n",
      "GÃ¡lvez de Montalvo maintained the tradition. Later in life, in the\n",
      "_Coloquio de los Perros_ (Dialogue of the Dogs), Cervantes made his\n",
      "Berganza say that all pastorals are \"vain imaginings, void of truth,\n",
      "written to amuse the idle\"; yet it may be doubted if Cervantes ever\n",
      "lost the pastoral taste, though his sense of humour forced him to see\n",
      "the absurdity of the convention. It is very certain that he had a\n",
      "special fondness for the _Galatea_: he spared it at the burning of Don\n",
      "Quixote's library, praised its invention, and made the Priest exhort\n",
      "the Barber to await the sequel which is foreshadowed in the _Galatea's_\n",
      "text. This is again promised in the Dedication of the volume of plays\n",
      "(1615), in the Prologue to the Second Part of _Don Quixote_ (1615),\n",
      "and in the Letter Dedicatory of _Persiles y Sigismunda_, signed on\n",
      "the writer's deathbed, April 19, 1616. For thirty-one years Cervantes\n",
      "held out the promise of the _Galatea's_ Second Part: five times did he\n",
      "repeat it. It is plain that he thought well of the First, and that his\n",
      "liking for the _genre_ was incorrigible.\n",
      "\n",
      "His own attempt survives chiefly because of the name on its\n",
      "title-page. Pastorals differ little in essentials, and the kind offers\n",
      "few openings to Cervantes' peculiar humoristic genius. Like his\n",
      "fellow-practitioners, he crowds his stage with figures: he presents his\n",
      "shepherds Elicio and Erastro warbling their love for Galatea on Tagus\n",
      "bank; he reveals Mirenio enamoured of Silveria, Leonarda love-sick\n",
      "for Salercio, Lenio in the toils of Gelasia. Hazlitt, in his harsh\n",
      "criticism of Sidney's _Arcadia_, hits the defects of the pastoral, and\n",
      "his censures may be justly applied to the _Galatea_. There, as in the\n",
      "English book, we find the \"original sin of alliteration, antithesis,\n",
      "and metaphysical conceit\"; there, too, is the \"systematic interpolation\n",
      "of the wit, learning, ingenuity, wisdom, and everlasting impertinence\n",
      "of the writer.\" Worst of all are \"the continual, uncalled-for\n",
      "interruptions, analysing, dissecting, disjointing, murdering\n",
      "everything, and reading a pragmatical, self-sufficient lecture over the\n",
      "dead body of nature.\" But if Cervantes sins in this wise, he sins of\n",
      "set purpose and in good company. In his Fourth Book, he interpolates a\n",
      "long disquisition on the Beautiful which he calmly annexes from Judas\n",
      "Abarbanel's _Dialoghi_. As Sannazaro opens his _Arcadia_ with Ergasto\n",
      "and Selvaggio, so Cervantes thrusts his Elicio and Erastro into the\n",
      "foreground of the _Galatea_; the funeral of Meliso is a deliberate\n",
      "imitation of the Feast of Pales; and, as the Italian introduced\n",
      "Carmosina Bonifacia under the name of Amaranta, the Spaniard perforce\n",
      "gives Catalina de Palacios Salazar as Galatea. Nor does he depart\n",
      "from the convention by placing himself upon the scene as Elicio, for\n",
      "Ribeiro and MontemÃ´r had preceded him in the characters of Bimnardel\n",
      "and Sereno. Lastly, the idea and the form of the _Canto de CalÃ­ope_,\n",
      "wherein the uncritical poet celebrates whole tribes of contemporary\n",
      "singers, are borrowed from the _Canto del Turia_, which Gil Polo had\n",
      "interpolated in his _Diana_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prolixity, artifice, ostentation, monotony, extravagance, are\n",
      "inherent in the pastoral school; and the _Galatea_ savours of these\n",
      "defects. Yet, for all its weakness, it lacks neither imagination nor\n",
      "contrivance, and its embroidered rhetoric is a fine example of stately\n",
      "prose. Save, perhaps, in the _Persiles y Sigismunda_, Cervantes never\n",
      "wrote with a more conscious effort after excellence, and, in results\n",
      "of absolute style, the _Galatea_ may compare with all but exceptional\n",
      "passages in _Don Quixote_. Yet it failed to please, and the author\n",
      "turned to other fields of effort. His verses in Pedro de Padilla's\n",
      "_JardÃ­n Espiritual_ (1585) and in LÃ³pez Maldonado's _Cancionero_ (1586)\n",
      "denote good-nature and a love of literature; and in both volumes\n",
      "Cervantes may have read companion-pieces written by a marvellous youth,\n",
      "Lope de Vega, whom he had already praisedâas he praised everybodyâin\n",
      "the _Canto de CalÃ­ope_. He could not foresee that in the person of\n",
      "this boy he was to meet his match and more. Meanwhile in 1587 he\n",
      "penned sonnets for Padilla's _Grandezas y Excelencias de la Virgen_,\n",
      "and for Alonso de Barros' _FilosofÃ­a cortesana_. Verse-making was his\n",
      "craze; and, in 1588, when the physician, Francisco DÃ­az, published a\n",
      "treatise on kidney diseaseâ_Tratado nuevamente impreso acerca de las\n",
      "enfermedades de los riÃ±ones_âthe unwearied poetaster was forthcoming\n",
      "with a sonnet pat to the strange occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, though he cultivated verse with as sedulous a passion as Don\n",
      "Quixote spent on Knight-Errantries, he recognised that man does not\n",
      "live by sonneteering alone, and he tried his fate upon the boards. He\n",
      "died with the happy conviction that he was a dramatist of genius; his\n",
      "contemporaries ruled the point against him, and posterity has upheld\n",
      "the decision. He tells us that at this time he wrote between twenty and\n",
      "thirty plays. We only know the titles of a few among themâthe _Gran\n",
      "Turquesca_, the _JerusalÃ©n_, the _Batalla Naval_ (attributed by MoratÃ­n\n",
      "to the year 1584), the _Amaranta_ and the _Bosque Amoroso_ (referred\n",
      "to 1586), the _Arsinda_ and the _Confusa_ (to 1587). It is like enough\n",
      "that the _Batalla Naval_ was concerned with Lepanto, a subject of which\n",
      "Cervantes never tired; the _Arsinda_ existed so late as 1673, when Juan\n",
      "de Matos Fragoso mentioned it as \"famous\" in his _Corsaria Catalana_;\n",
      "and our author himself ranked the _Confusa_ as \"good among the best.\"\n",
      "The touch of self-complacency is amusing, though one might desire a\n",
      "better security than Bardolph's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two surviving plays of the period are _El Trato de Argel_ and _La\n",
      "Numancia_, first printed by Antonio de Sancha in 1784. The former deals\n",
      "with the life of the Christian slaves in Algiers, and recounts the\n",
      "passion of Zara the Moor for the captive Aurelio, who is enamoured of\n",
      "Silvia. We must assume that Cervantes thought well of this invention,\n",
      "since he utilised it some thirty years later in _El Amante Liberal_;\n",
      "but the play is merely futile. The introduction of a lion, of the\n",
      "Devil, and of such abstractions as Necessity and Opportunity, is as\n",
      "poor a piece of machinery as theatre ever saw; the versification\n",
      "is rough and creaking, improvised without care or conscience; the\n",
      "situations are arranged with a glaring disregard for truth and\n",
      "probability. Like Paolo Veronese, Cervantes could rarely resist the\n",
      "temptation of painting himself into his canvas, and in _El Trato de\n",
      "Argel_ he takes care that the prisoner Saavedra should declaim his\n",
      "tirade. The piece has no dramatic interest, and is valuable merely\n",
      "as an over-coloured picture of vicissitudes by one who knew them at\n",
      "first-hand, and who presented them to his countrymen with a more or\n",
      "less didactic intention. Yet, even as a transcript of manners, this\n",
      "luckless play is a failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "A finer example of Cervantes' dramatic power is the _Numancia_, on\n",
      "which Shelley has passed this generous judgment:â\"I have read the\n",
      "_Numancia_, and, after wading through the singular stupidity of the\n",
      "First Act, began to be greatly delighted, and at length interested in\n",
      "a very high degree, by the power of the writer in awakening pity and\n",
      "admiration, in which I hardly know by whom he is excelled. There is\n",
      "little, I allow, to be called _poetry_ in this play; but the command\n",
      "of language and the harmony of versification is so great as to deceive\n",
      "one into an idea that it is poetry.\" Nor is Shelley alone in his\n",
      "admiration. Goethe's avowal to Humboldt is on record:â\"Sogar habe\n",
      "ich ... neulich das Trauerspiel _Numancia_ von Cervantes mit vielem\n",
      "VergnÃ¼gen gelesen;\" but eight years later he confided a revised\n",
      "judgment to Riemer. The gushing school of German Romantics waxed\n",
      "delirious in praise. Thus Friedrich Schlegel surpassed himself by\n",
      "calling the play \"godlike\"; and August Schlegel, not content to hold it\n",
      "for a dramatic masterpiece, would persuade us to accept it for great\n",
      "poetry. Even Sismondi declares that \"le frisson de l'horreur et de\n",
      "l'effroi devient presque un supplice pour le spectateur.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Raptures apart, the _Numancia_ is Cervantes' best play. He has a\n",
      "grandiose subject: the siege of Numantia, and its capture by Scipio\n",
      "Africanus after fourteen years of resistance. On the Roman side were\n",
      "eighty thousand soldiers; the Spaniards numbered four thousand or less;\n",
      "and the victors entered the fallen city to find no soul alive. With\n",
      "scenes of valour is mingled the pathetic love-story of Morandro and\n",
      "Lyra. But, once again, Cervantes fails as a dramatic artist; one doubts\n",
      "if he knew what a plot was, what unity of conception meant. He has\n",
      "scenes and episodes of high excellence, but they are detached from the\n",
      "main composition, and produce all the bad effect of a portrait painted\n",
      "in different lights. Abstractions fill the stageâWar, Sickness,\n",
      "Hunger, Spain, the river Duero. But the tirades of rhetoric are\n",
      "unsurpassed by anything from Cervantes' pen, and Marquino's scene with\n",
      "the corpse in the Second Act is pregnant with a suggestion of weirdness\n",
      "which Mr. Gibson has well conveyed:â\n",

      "Here, once more, we are dealing with a passage which gains by\n",
      "detachment from its context. To speak plainly, the interest of the\n",
      "_Numancia_ is not dramatic, and its versification, good of its kind,\n",
      "may easily be overpraised, as it was by Shelley. First and last, the\n",
      "play is a devout and passionate expression of patriotism; and, as\n",
      "such, the writer's countrymen have held it in esteem, never claiming\n",
      "for it the qualities invented by well-meaning foreigners. Lope de Vega\n",
      "and CalderÃ³n still hold the stage, from which Cervantes, the disciple\n",
      "of ViruÃ©s, was driven three centuries ago; and they survive, the one\n",
      "as an hundredfold more potent dramatist, the other as an infinitely\n",
      "greater poet. Yet, like the ghost raised by Marquino, Cervantes was\n",
      "to undergo a momentary resurrection. When Palafox (and Byron's Maid)\n",
      "held Zaragoza, during the War of Independence, against the batteries\n",
      "of Mortier, Junot, and Lannes, the _Numancia_ was played within the\n",
      "besieged walls, so that Spaniards of the nineteenth century might see\n",
      "that their fathers had known how to die for freedom. The tragedy was\n",
      "received with enthusiasm; the marshals of the world's Greatest Captain\n",
      "were repulsed and beaten; and Cervantes' inspiriting lines helped on\n",
      "the victory. In life, he had never met with such a triumph, and in\n",
      "death no other could have pleased him better.\n",
      "\n",
      "He asserts, indeed, that his plays were popular, and he may have\n",
      "persuaded himself into that belief. His idolaters preach the legend\n",
      "that he was driven from the boards by that \"portent of genius,\" Lope\n",
      "de Vega. This tale is a vain imagining. Cervantes failed so wretchedly\n",
      "in art that in 1588 he left the Madrid stage to seek work in Seville;\n",
      "and no play of Lope's dates so early as that, save one written while\n",
      "he was at school. In June 1588, Cervantes became Deputy-Purveyor to\n",
      "the Invincible Armada, and in May 1590 he petitioned for one of four\n",
      "appointments vacant in Granada, Guatemala, Cartagena, and La Paz. But\n",
      "he never quite abandoned literature. In 1591 he wrote a _romance_\n",
      "for AndrÃ©s de Villalba's _Flor de varios y nuevos romances_, and, in\n",
      "the following year, he contracted with the Seville manager, Rodrigo\n",
      "Osorio, to write six comedies at fifty ducats eachâno money to be paid\n",
      "unless Osorio should rank the plays \"among the best in Spain.\" No more\n",
      "is heard of this agreement, and Cervantes disappears till 1594, when\n",
      "he was appointed tax-gatherer in Granada. Next year he competed at a\n",
      "literary tournament held by the Dominicans of Zaragoza in honour of\n",
      "St. Hyacinth, and won the first prizeâthree silver spoons. His sonnet\n",
      "to the famous sea-dog, Santa Cruz, is printed in CristÃ³bal Mosquera\n",
      "de Figueroa's _Comentario en breve Compendio de Disciplina militar_\n",

      "In 1597, being in Seville about the time of Herrera's death, Cervantes\n",

      "fame, the ruined man lingered at Seville, where, in 1598, he wrote two\n",
      "sonnets and a copy of _quintillas_ on Felipe II.'s death. Four years of\n",
      "silence were followed by the inevitable sonnet in the second edition of\n",
      "Lope de Vega's _Dragontea_ (1602). It is certain that all this while\n",
      "Cervantes was scribbling in some naked garret; but his name seemed\n",
      "almost forgotten from the earth. In 1603 he was run to ground, and\n",
      "served with an Exchequer writ concerning those outstanding balances,\n",
      "still unpaid after nearly eight years. He must appear in person at\n",
      "Valladolid to offer what excuse he might. Light as his baggage was,\n",
      "it contained one precious, immediate jewelâthe manuscript of _Don\n",

      "harder than to draw blood from a stone: the debt remained unsettled.\n",

      "counter of Francisco de Robles, bookseller to the King. Cervantes\n",
      "dedicated his volume, in terms boldly filched from Herrera and Medina,\n",

      "equalled that of _GuzmÃ¡n de Alfarache_, and by July a fifth edition\n",

      "of dementia; and, in England and Spain, the afflicted have shown both\n",
      "authors much reciprocal attention. We must even take Cervantes as he\n",
      "was: a literary artist stronger in practice than in theory, great by\n",
      "natural faculty rather than by acquired accomplishment. His learning\n",
      "is naught, his reasonings are futile, his speculation is banal. In\n",
      "short passages he is one of the greatest masters of Castilian prose,\n",
      "clear, direct, and puissant: but he soon tires, and is prone to lapse\n",
      "into Italian idioms, or into irritating sentences packed with needless\n",

      "the sly hits at foes, are mostly mysteries for us, though they amuse\n",
      "the laborious leisure of the commentator. Chivalresque romances are\n",
      "with last year's snows: but the interest of _Don Quixote_ abides for\n",
      "ever. Cervantes set out intending to write a comic short story, and the\n",
      "design grew under his hand till at length it included a whole Human\n",
      "Comedy. He himself was as near akin to Don Quixote as a man may be:\n",
      "he knew his chivalresque romances by heart, and accounted _AmadÃ­s de\n",
      "Gaula_ as \"the very best contrived book of all those of that kind.\" Yet\n",

      "no new chivalresque romance was written, and only oneâthe _Caballero\n",
      "del Febo_ (1617)âwas reprinted. And the reason is obvious. It was\n",
      "not that Cervantes' work was merely destructive, that he was simply\n",

      "abundance of ingenious fantasy, by sublimation of character, by wealth\n",
      "of episode and incident, and by the genius of satiric portraiture. He\n",

      "and had shown hostility in other ways. Lope, secure in his high seat,\n",
      "made no reply, and in 1612 (in another private letter) he speaks kindly\n",
      "of Cervantes. \"Cervantophils\" insist upon being too clever by half.\n",
      "They first assert that the outward form of Avellaneda's book was an\n",
      "imitation of _Don Quixote_, and that the intention was \"to pass off\n",
      "this spurious Second Part as the true one\"; they then contend that\n",
      "Avellaneda's was \"a deliberate attempt to spoil the work of Cervantes.\"\n",
      "These two statements are mutually destructive: one must necessarily\n",
      "be false. It is also argued, first, that Avellaneda's is a worthless\n",
      "book; next, that it was written by Lope, the greatest figure, save\n",
      "Cervantes, in Spanish literature. Lope had many jealous enemies, but no\n",
      "contemporary hints at such a charge, and no proof is offered in support\n",
      "of it now. Indeed the notion, first started by MÃ¡inez, is generally\n",
      "abandoned. Other ascriptions, involving Blanco de Paz, Ruiz de AlarcÃ³n,\n",
      "AndrÃ©s PÃ©rez, are equally futile. The most plausible conjecture, due\n",
      "to D. Marcelino MenÃ©ndez y Pelayo, is that Avellaneda was a certain\n",
      "Aragonese, Alfonso Lamberto. Lamberto's very obscurity favours this\n",
      "surmise. Had Avellaneda been a figure of great importance, he had been\n",
      "unmasked by Cervantes himself, who assuredly was no coward.\n",
      "\n",
      "We owe to Avellaneda a clever, brutal, cynical, amusing book, which\n",
      "is still reprinted. Nor is this our only debt to him: he put an end\n",
      "to Cervantes' dawdling and procured the publication of the second\n",
      "_Don Quixote_. Cervantes left it doubtful if he meant to write the\n",
      "sequel; he even seems to invite another to undertake it. Nine years had\n",
      "passed, during which Cervantes made no sign. Avellaneda, with an eye to\n",
      "profit, wrote his continuation in good faith, and his insolent Preface\n",
      "is explained by his rage at seeing the bread taken out of his mouth\n",
      "when the true sequel was announced in the Preface to the _Novelas_.\n",
      "Had not his intrusion stung Cervantes to the quick, the second _Don\n",
      "Quixote_ might have met the fate of the second _Galatea_âpromised for\n",
      "thirty years and never finished. As it is, the hurried close of the\n",
      "Second Part is below the writer's common level, as when he rages at\n",
      "Avellaneda, and wishes that the latter's book be \"cast into the lowest\n",
      "pit of hell.\" But this is its single fault, which, for the rest, is\n",
      "only found in the last fourteen chapters. The previous fifty-eight\n",
      "form an almost impeccable masterpiece. As an achievement in style, the\n",
      "Second excels the First Part. The parody of chivalresque books is less\n",
      "insistent, the interest is larger, the variety of episode is ampler,\n",
      "the spirit more subtly comic, the new characters are more convincing,\n",
      "the manner is more urbane, more assured. Cervantes' First Part was an\n",
      "experiment in which he himself but half believed; in the Second he\n",
      "shows the certainty of an accepted master, confident of his intention\n",
      "and his popularity. So his career closed in a blaze of triumph. He had\n",
      "other works in hand: a play to be called _El EngaÃ±o Ã¡ los Ojos_, the\n",
      "_Semanas del JardÃ­n_, the _Famoso Bernardo_, and the eternal second\n",
      "_Galatea_. These last three he promises in the Preface to _Los Trabajos\n",
      "de Persiles y Sigismunda_ (1617), a posthumous volume \"that dares\n",

      "written in our tongue.\" Ambitious in aim and in manner, the _Persiles_\n",
      "has failed to interest, for all its adventures and scapes. Yet it\n",
      "contains perhaps the finest, and certainly the most pathetic passage\n",

      "  \"_Puesto ya el piÃ© en el estribo_\"â\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One foot already in the stirrup.\" With these words he smilingly\n",
      "confronts fate, and makes him ready for the last post down the Valley\n",
      "of the Shadow. He died on April 23, nominally on the same day as\n",
      "Shakespeare, whose death is dated by an unreformed calendar. They were\n",
      "brethren in their lives and afterwards. Montesquieu, in the _Lettres\n",
      "Persanes_, makes Rica say of the Spaniards that \"le seul de leurs\n",

      "\"prodigy of nature,\" as his rival confesses. A prodigy he was from his\n",
      "cradle. At the age of five he lisped in numbers, and, unable to write,\n",
      "would bribe his schoolmates with a share of his breakfast to take down\n",
      "verses at his dictation. He came of noble highland blood, his father,\n",
      "FÃ©lix de Vega, and his mother, Francisca FernÃ¡ndez, being natives of\n",
      "Carriedo. Born in Madrid, he was there educated at the Jesuit Colegio\n",
      "Imperial, of which he was the wonder. All the accomplishments were his:\n",
      "still a child, he filled his copy-books with verses, sang, danced,\n",
      "handled the foil like a trained sworder. His father, a poet of some\n",
      "accomplishment, died early, and Lope forthwith determined to see the\n",
      "world. With his comrade, Hernando MuÃ±oz, he ran away from school. The\n",
      "pair reached Astorga, and turned back to Segovia, where, being short\n",
      "of money, they tried to sell a chain to a jeweller, who, suspecting\n",
      "something to be wrong, informed the local Dogberry. The adventurous\n",
      "couple were sent home in charge of the police. Lope's earliest\n",
      "surviving play, _El verdadero Amante_, written in his thirteenth year,\n",

      "NicolÃ¡s de los RÃ­os, one of the best actor-managers of his time,\n",
      "was proud to play in it later; and, crude as it is in phrasing, it\n",
      "manifests an astonishing dramatic gift.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chronology of Lope's youth is perplexing, and the events of this\n",
      "time are, as a rule, wrongly given by his biographers, even including\n",
      "that admirable scholar, Cayetano Alberto de la Barrera y Leirado,\n",
      "whose _Nueva BiografÃ­a_ is almost above praise. In a poetic epistle\n",
      "to Luis de Haro, Lope asserts that he fought at Terceira against\n",
      "the Portuguese: \"in my third lustre\"â_en tres lustros de mi edad\n",
      "primera_: and Ticknor is puzzled to reconcile this with facts. It\n",
      "cannot be done. Lope was fifteen in 1577, and the expedition to the\n",
      "Azores occurred in 1582. The obvious explanation is that Lope was in\n",
      "his fourth lustre, but that, as _cuatro_ would break the rhythm of\n",
      "the line, he wrote _tres_ instead. Some little licence is admitted in\n",
      "verse, and literal interpreters are peculiarly liable to error. At\n",
      "the same time, it should be said that Lope is coquettish as regards\n",
      "his age. Thus, he says that he was a child at the time of the Armada,\n",
      "being really twenty-six; and that he wrote the _Dragontea_ in early\n",
      "youth, when, in fact, he was thirty-five. This little vanity has led to\n",
      "endless confusion. It is commonly stated that, on Lope's return from\n",
      "the Azores, he entered the household of GerÃ³nimo Manrique, Bishop of\n",
      "Ãvila, who sent him to AlcalÃ¡ de Henares. That Lope studied at AlcalÃ¡\n",
      "is certain; but undergraduates then matriculated earlier than they do\n",
      "now. When Lope's first campaign ended he was twenty-one, and therefore\n",
      "too old for college. He was a Bachelor before ever he went to the\n",
      "wars. The love-affair, recounted in his _Dorotea_, is commonly said to\n",
      "have prevented his taking orders at AlcalÃ¡: in truth, he never saw the\n",
      "lady till he came back from the Azores! He became private secretary to\n",
      "Antonio Ãlvarez de Toledo y Beaumont, fifth Duque de Alba, and grandson\n",
      "of the great soldier; but the date cannot be given precisely. As far\n",
      "back as 1572 he had translated Claudian's _Rape of Proserpine_ into\n",
      "Castilian verse, and we have already seen him joined with Cervantes in\n",
      "penning complimentary sonnets for Padilla and LÃ³pez Maldonado (1584).\n",
      "It may be that, while in Alba's service, he wrote the poems printed in\n",
      "Pedro de Moncayo's _Flor de varios romances_ (1589).\n",
      "\n",
      "The history of these years is obscure. It is usually asserted that,\n",
      "while in Alba's service, about the year 1584-5, Lope married, and\n",
      "that he was soon afterwards exiled to Valencia, whence he set out\n",
      "for Lisbon to join the Invincible Armada. This does not square with\n",
      "Lope's statement in the Dedication of _Querer la propia Desdicha_ to\n",
      "Claudio Conde. There he alleges that Conde helped him out of prison\n",
      "in Madrid, a service repaid by his helping Conde out of the Serranos\n",
      "prison at Valencia, and he goes on to say that \"before the first down\n",
      "was on their cheeks\" they went to Lisbon to embark on the Armada. He\n",
      "nowhere alleges that they started from Valencia, or that the journey\n",
      "followed the banishment. In an eclogue to the same Conde, Lope avers\n",
      "that he joined the Armada to escape from Filis (otherwise Dorotea),\n",
      "and he adds:â\"Who could have thought that, returning from the war,\n",
      "I should find a sweet wife?\" The question would be pointless if Lope\n",
      "were already married. Moreover, Barrera's theory that the intrigue\n",
      "with Dorotea ended in 1584 is disproved by the fact that the _Dorotea_\n",
      "contains allusions to the Conde de Melgar's marriage, which, as we know\n",
      "from Cabrera, took place in 1587. What is certain is that Lope went\n",
      "aboard the _San Juan_, and that during the Armada expedition he used\n",
      "his manuscript verses in Filis's praise for gun-wads.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a first-class fighting-man, and played his part in the combats\n",
      "up the Channel, where his brother was killed beside him during an\n",
      "encounter between the _San Juan_ and eight Dutch vessels. Disaster\n",
      "never quenched his spirit nor stayed his pen; for, when what was left\n",
      "of the defeated Armada returned to CÃ¡diz, he landed with the greater\n",
      "part of his _Hermosura de AngÃ©lica_âeleven thousand verses, written\n",
      "between storm and battle, in continuation of the _Orlando Furioso_.\n",
      "First published in 1602, the _AngÃ©lica_ comes short of Ariosto's epic\n",
      "nobility, and is unrelieved by the Italian's touch of ironic fantasy.\n",
      "Nor can it be called successful even as a sequel: its very wealth\n",
      "of invention, its redundant episodes and innumerable digressions,\n",
      "contribute to its failure. But the verse is singularly brilliant and\n",
      "effective, while the skill with which the writer handles proper names\n",
      "is almost Miltonic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Returned to Spain, Lope composed his pastoral novel, the _Arcadia_,\n",
      "which, however, remained unpublished till 1598. Ticknor believed it \"to\n",
      "have been written almost immediately\" after Cervantes' _Galatea_: this\n",
      "cannot be, for the _Arcadia_ refers to the death of Santa Cruz, which\n",
      "occurred in 1588, and it discusses in the conventional manner Alba's\n",
      "love-affairs of 1589-90. The _Arcadia_, where Lope figures as Belardo,\n",
      "and Alba as Amfriso, makes no pretence to be a transcript of manners\n",
      "or life, and it is intolerably prolix withal. Yet it goes beyond its\n",
      "fellows by virtue of its vivid landscapes, its graceful, flowing verse,\n",
      "and a certain rich, poetic, Latinized prose, here used by Lope with\n",
      "as much artistry as he showed in his management of the more familiar\n",
      "kind in the _Dorotea_. Its popularity is proved by the publication\n",
      "of fifteen editions in its author's lifetime. About the year 1590 he\n",
      "married Isabel de Urbina, a distant connection of Cervantes' mother,\n",
      "and daughter of Felipe II.'s King-at-Arms. Hereupon followed a duel,\n",
      "wherein Lope wounded his adversary, and, earlier escapades being raked\n",
      "up, he was banished the capital. He spent some time in Valencia, a\n",
      "considerable literary centre; but in 1594 he signed the manuscript of\n",
      "his play, _El Maestro de danzar_, at Tormes, Alba's estate, whence\n",
      "it is inferred that he was once more in the Duke's service. A new\n",
      "love-affair with Antonia Trillo de Armenta brought legal troubles upon\n",
      "him in 1596. His wife apparently died in 1597.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first considerable work printed with Lope's name upon the\n",
      "title-page was his _Dragontea_ (1598), an epic poem in ten cantos\n",
      "on the last cruise and death of Francis Drake. We naturally love to\n",
      "think of the mighty seaman as the patriot, the chiefest of Britannia's\n",
      "bulwarks, as he figures in Mr. Newbolt's spirited ballad:â\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"_Drake lies in his hammock till the great Armadas come ...\n",
      "  Slung atween the round shot, listenin' for the drum ...\n",

      "\n",
      "Odd to say, though, Lope has been censured for not viewing Drake\n",
      "through English Protestant spectacles. Seeing that he was a good\n",
      "Catholic Spaniard whom Drake had drummed up the Channel, it had been\n",
      "curious if the _Dragontea_ were other than it is: a savage denunciation\n",
      "of that Babylonian Dragon, that son of the devil whose piracies had\n",
      "tormented Spain during thirty years. The _Dragontea_ fails not because\n",
      "of its national spirit, which is wholly admirable, but because of its\n",
      "excessive emphasis and its abuse of allegory. Its author scarcely\n",
      "intended it for great poetry; but, as a patriotic screed, it fulfilled\n",
      "its purpose, and, when reprinted, it drew an approving sonnet from\n",
      "Cervantes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The _Dragontea_ was written while Lope was in the household of the\n",

      "within twenty-four hours. Working in these conditions, he must needs\n",

      "and his phrase is too often more vigorous than finished. But it is\n",
      "not as a master of artistic detail that Lope's countrymen place him\n",
      "beside Cervantes. First, and last, and always, he is a great creative\n",
      "genius. He incarnates the national spirit, adapts popular poetry to\n",
      "dramatic effects, substitutes characters for abstractions, and, in\n",
      "a word, expresses the genius of a people. It is true that he rarely\n",
      "finds a perfect form for his utterance, that he constantly approaches\n",
      "perfection without quite attaining unto it, that his dramatic instinct\n",
      "exceeds his literary execution. Yet he survives as the creator of\n",
      "an original form. His successors improved upon him in the matter of\n",
      "polish, yet not one of them made an essential departure of his own, not\n",
      "one invented a radical variant upon Lope's method. Tirso de Molina may\n",
      "exceed him in force of conception, as Ruiz de AlarcÃ³n outshines him in\n",
      "ethical significance, in exposition of character; yet Tirso and AlarcÃ³n\n",

      "usages of the time. Tirso, AlarcÃ³n, and CalderÃ³n are a most brilliant\n",
      "progeny; but the father of them all is the unrivalled Lope. He seized\n",
      "upon what germs of good existed in Torres Naharro, Rueda, and Cueva;\n",
      "but his debt to them was small, and he would have found his way without\n",

      "dramatic motive and of chivalrous conduct. He professed an abstract\n",

      "phrase, \"imitated men's actions, and reproduced the manners of the\n",

      "that the business of the scene is to hold an audience, is to interest,\n",
      "to surprise, to move. He could not thump a pulpit in an empty hall: he\n",
      "perceived that a play which fails to attract isâfor the playwright's\n",
      "purposeâa bad play. He can be read with infinite pleasure; yet he\n",

      "It is difficult to fix upon the period when Lope's dramatic genius was\n",
      "accepted by his public: 1592 seems a likely date. He took no interest\n",
      "in publishing his plays, though _El Perseguido_ was issued by a Lisbon\n",
      "pirate so early as 1603. Eight volumes of his theatre were in print\n",

      "Of the Aragonese playwright, Lupercio Leonardo de Argensola, we have\n",
      "already spoken in a previous chapter. His brother, BARTOLOMÃ LEONARDO\n",
      "DE ARGENSOLA (1562-1631), took orders, and, through the influence of\n",
      "the Duque de Villahermosa, was named rector of the town whence his\n",
      "patron took his title. His earliest work, the _Conquista de las Islas\n",
      "Molucas_ (1609), written by order of the Conde de Lemos, is uncritical\n",
      "in conception and design; but the matter of its primitive, romantic,\n",
      "and even sentimental legends derives fresh charm from the author's apt\n",
      "and polished narrative. In 1611 he and his brother accompanied Lemos\n",
      "to Naples, thereby stirring the anger of Cervantes, who had hoped to\n",
      "be among the Viceroy's suite, as appears from a passage in the _Viaje\n",
      "del Parnaso_, which roundly insinuates that the Argensolas were a\n",
      "pair of intriguers. The disappointment was natural; yet posterity is\n",
      "even grateful for it, since a transfer to Naples would certainly have\n",
      "lost us the second _Don Quixote_. Doubtless the Argensolas, who were\n",
      "of Italian descent, were better fitted than Cervantes for commerce\n",
      "with Italian affairs, and BartolomÃ© made friends on all sides in\n",
      "Naples as in Rome. On his brother's death in 1613, he became official\n",
      "chronicler of AragÃ³n, and, in 1631, published a sequel to _Zurita_,\n",
      "the _Anales de AragÃ³n_, which deals so minutely with the events of the\n",
      "years 1516-20 as to become wearisome, despite all Argensola's grace of\n",
      "manner. The _Rimas_ of the two brothers, published posthumously in 1634\n",
      "by Lupercio's son, Gabriel Leonardo de AlbiÃ³n, was stamped with the\n",
      "approval of the dictator, Lope de Vega, who declared that the authors\n",

      "which is suffering from new horrible phrases, more puzzling than\n",

      "\n",
      "This is an overstatement of a truth, due to Lope's aversion from\n",

      "whose renderings of the two odes _Ibam forte via sacra_ and _Beatus\n",
      "ille_ are among the happiest of versions. Their sobriety of thought\n",
      "is austere, and their classic correctness of diction is in curious\n",
      "contrast with the daring innovations of their time. Lupercio has a\n",

      "accuse Hillebrand of writing nonsense, but he certainly comes near,\n",
      "perilously near it in this case. Lyly's _Euphues_ was published in\n",
      "1579, while GÃ³ngora was still a student at Salamanca, and Shakespeare\n",
      "died nearly twelve years before a line of GÃ³ngora's later poems was in\n",
      "print. Spanish scholars, indeed, disclaim responsibility for Euphuism\n",
      "in any shape. They refuse to admit that Lord Berners' or North's\n",
      "translations of Guevara could have produced the effects ascribed to\n",
      "them; and they argue with much reason that Gongorism is but the local\n",
      "form of a disease which attacked all Europe. However that may be, there\n",
      "can exist no possible connection between English Euphuism and Spanish\n",
      "Gongorism, save such as comes from a common Italian origin. Gongorism\n",

      "effect of affectation. He wilfully got rid of his natural directness,\n",

      "his head whenever he mentions GÃ³ngora's name, and holds the Spaniard\n",
      "up to ridicule by printing a literal translation of his more daring\n",
      "flights. Thus he chooses a passage from the first of the _Soledades_,\n",
      "and asserts that GÃ³ngora sings the praise of \"a maiden so beautiful,\n",
      "that she might parch up Norway with her two suns, and bleach Ethiopia\n",
      "with her two hands.\" Perhaps no poet that ever lived would survive the\n",
      "test of such bald, literal rendering as this, and a much more exact\n",

      "kindâof a kind very current among fourth-form boys, and, perpetrated\n",

      "grand-daughter in the fifth generation of Santillana. His reputation\n",
      "as a gambler was of the worst, and his winning thirty thousand gold\n",
      "ducats at a sitting led to his expulsion from court in 1608. He joined\n",
      "the army in Italy, returned to Spain in 1617, and at once launched\n",
      "into epigrams and satires against all and sundry. The court favourites\n",
      "were his special markâLerma, Osuna, Uceda, Rodrigo CalderÃ³n. In 1618\n",
      "he was again banished, but returned in 1621 as Lord-in-Waiting to the\n",
      "Queen, Isabel de Bourbon, daughter of Henry of Navarre. At her request\n",

      "acted on April 8, 1622, before Lord Bristol. If report speak truly,\n",
      "the performance led him to his death. When the second act opened, an\n",

      "he attempts the sacramental play. This kind of drama would almost\n",
      "seem created for the greater glory of CalderÃ³n. The personages\n",
      "of his worldly plays, and even of his _comedias devotas_, tend\n",
      "to become personifications of revenge, love, pride, charity, and\n",
      "the rest. His set pieces are disfigured by want of humour and by\n",

      "abstractions are wedded to the noblest poetry, where the Beyond is\n",
      "brought down to earth, and where doctrinal subtleties are embellished\n",
      "with miraculous ingenuity. To assert that CalderÃ³n is incomparably\n",
      "great in the _autos_ is to imply some censure of his art in his\n",
      "secular dramas. The monotony and artifice of his sacramental plays\n",
      "might be thought inherent to the species, were not these two notes\n",
      "characteristic of his whole theatre. Nor is it an explanation to say\n",
      "that much writing of _autos_ had affected his general methods; for\n",
      "not merely are the secular plays more numerousâthey are also mostly\n",
      "earlier than the _autos_, whose real defects are a lack of dramatic\n",

      "with a turn for _culteranismo_, averse from the picaresque contrasts\n",
      "which lend variety to Lope's scene and to Tirso's. His interpretation\n",
      "of existence is so idealised that his stage becomes in some sort the\n",
      "apotheosis of his century. His characters are not so much men and\n",
      "women, as allegorical types of men and women as CalderÃ³n conceived\n",
      "them. It is not real life that he reveals, for he regarded realism as\n",
      "ignoble and unclean: he offers in its place a brilliant pageant of\n",
      "abstract emotions. He is not a universal dramatist: he ranks with the\n",
      "greatest writers for the Spanish stage, inasmuch as he is the greatest\n",
      "poet using the dramatic form. And, leaving aside his anachronisms and\n",
      "jumblings of mythology, he is a scrupulous artist, careful of his\n",

      "(Old-time Memories). It was his misfortune to be concerned in politics,\n",
      "for which he was unfitted, and to be pinched by continuous poverty,\n",
      "which drove him in 1855 to seek his fortune in Mexico, whence he\n",

      "his straitened circumstances; but this is difficult to believe. He\n",

      "three generations of Spaniards, and which seems likely to endure,\n",
      "implies the possession of considerable powers. And Zorrilla had three\n",
      "essential qualities in no common degree: national spirit, dramatic\n",
      "insight, and lyrical spontaneity. He is an inferior Sir Walter, with\n",
      "an added knowledge of the theatre, to which Scott made no pretence.\n",
      "His _Leyenda de Alhamar_, his _Granada_, his _Leyenda del Cid_ were\n",
      "popular for the same reason that _Marmion_ and the _Lady of the Lake_\n",
      "were popular: for their revival of national legends in a form both\n",
      "simple and picturesque. The fate that overcame Sir Walter's poems seems\n",
      "to threaten Zorrilla's. Both are read for the sake of the subject,\n",
      "for the brilliant colouring of episodes, more than for the beauty of\n",

      "wide and lasting that it almost approaches immortality. In the study\n",

      "It is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great town,\n",
      "or travel in the country, when they see the streets, the roads and\n",
      "cabbin-doors crowded with beggars of the female sex, followed by three,\n",
      "four, or six children, all in rags, and importuning every passenger for\n",
      "an alms. These mothers instead of being able to work for their honest\n",
      "livelihood, are forced to employ all their time in stroling to beg\n",
      "sustenance for their helpless infants who, as they grow up, either turn\n",
      "thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country, to fight\n",
      "for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of\n",
      "children in the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their mothers,\n",
      "and frequently of their fathers, is in the present deplorable state of\n",
      "the kingdom, a very great additional grievance; and therefore whoever\n",
      "could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of making these children\n",
      "sound and useful members of the common-wealth, would deserve so well of\n",
      "the publick, as to have his statue set up for a preserver of the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "But my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the\n",
      "children of professed beggars: it is of a much greater extent, and shall\n",
      "take in the whole number of infants at a certain age, who are born of\n",
      "parents in effect as little able to support them, as those who demand\n",
      "our charity in the streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years, upon this\n",
      "important subject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of\n",
      "our projectors, I have always found them grossly mistaken in their\n",
      "computation. It is true, a child just dropt from its dam, may be\n",
      "supported by her milk, for a solar year, with little other nourishment:\n",
      "at most not above the value of two shillings, which the mother may\n",
      "certainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful occupation of\n",
      "begging; and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to provide for\n",
      "them in such a manner, as, instead of being a charge upon their parents,\n",
      "or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest of their lives,\n",
      "they shall, on the contrary, contribute to the feeding, and partly to\n",
      "the cloathing of many thousands.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is likewise another great advantage in my scheme, that it will\n",
      "prevent those voluntary abortions, and that horrid practice of\n",
      "women murdering their bastard children, alas! too frequent among us,\n",
      "sacrificing the poor innocent babes, I doubt, more to avoid the expence\n",
      "than the shame, which would move tears and pity in the most savage and\n",
      "inhuman breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million\n",
      "and a half, of these I calculate there may be about two hundred thousand\n",
      "couple whose wives are breeders; from which number I subtract thirty\n",
      "thousand couple, who are able to maintain their own children, (although\n",
      "I apprehend there cannot be so many, under the present distresses of\n",
      "the kingdom) but this being granted, there will remain an hundred and\n",
      "seventy thousand breeders. I again subtract fifty thousand, for those\n",
      "women who miscarry, or whose children die by accident or disease within\n",
      "the year. There only remain an hundred and twenty thousand children of\n",
      "poor parents annually born. The question therefore is, How this number\n",
      "shall be reared, and provided for? which, as I have already said, under\n",
      "the present situation of affairs, is utterly impossible by all the\n",
      "methods hitherto proposed. For we can neither employ them in handicraft\n",
      "or agriculture; they neither build houses, (I mean in the country) nor\n",
      "cultivate land: they can very seldom pick up a livelihood by stealing\n",
      "till they arrive at six years old; except where they are of towardly\n",
      "parts, although I confess they learn the rudiments much earlier;\n",
      "during which time they can however be properly looked upon only as\n",
      "probationers: As I have been informed by a principal gentleman in the\n",
      "county of Cavan, who protested to me, that he never knew above one or\n",
      "two instances under the age of six, even in a part of the kingdom so\n",
      "renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am assured by our merchants, that a boy or a girl before twelve years\n",
      "old, is no saleable commodity, and even when they come to this age, they\n",
      "will not yield above three pounds, or three pounds and half a crown\n",
      "at most, on the exchange; which cannot turn to account either to the\n",
      "parents or kingdom, the charge of nutriments and rags having been at\n",
      "least four times that value.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will\n",
      "not be liable to the least objection.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in\n",
      "London, that a young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a\n",
      "most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted,\n",
      "baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a\n",
      "fricasie, or a ragoust.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do therefore humbly offer it to publick consideration, that of the\n",
      "hundred and twenty thousand children, already computed, twenty thousand\n",
      "may be reserved for breed, whereof only one fourth part to be males;\n",
      "which is more than we allow to sheep, black cattle, or swine, and my\n",
      "reason is, that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage, a\n",
      "circumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore, one male will\n",
      "be sufficient to serve four females. That the remaining hundred thousand\n",
      "may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the persons of quality and\n",
      "fortune, through the kingdom, always advising the mother to let them\n",
      "suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render them plump, and fat\n",
      "for a good table. A child will make two dishes at an entertainment for\n",
      "friends, and when the family dines alone, the fore or hind quarter will\n",
      "make a reasonable dish, and seasoned with a little pepper or salt, will\n",
      "be very good boiled on the fourth day, especially in winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have reckoned upon a medium, that a child just born will weigh 12\n",
      "pounds, and in a solar year, if tolerably nursed, encreaseth to 28\n",
      "pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "I grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for\n",
      "landlords, who, as they have already devoured most of the parents, seem\n",
      "to have the best title to the children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Infant's flesh will be in season throughout the year, but more plentiful\n",
      "in March, and a little before and after; for we are told by a grave\n",
      "author, an eminent French physician, that fish being a prolifick dyet,\n",
      "there are more children born in Roman Catholick countries about nine\n",
      "months after Lent, the markets will be more glutted than usual, because\n",
      "the number of Popish infants, is at least three to one in this kingdom,\n",
      "and therefore it will have one other collateral advantage, by lessening\n",
      "the number of Papists among us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have already computed the charge of nursing a beggar's child (in which\n",
      "list I reckon all cottagers, labourers, and four-fifths of the farmers)\n",
      "to be about two shillings per annum, rags included; and I believe no\n",
      "gentleman would repine to give ten shillings for the carcass of a good\n",
      "fat child, which, as I have said, will make four dishes of excellent\n",
      "nutritive meat, when he hath only some particular friend, or his\n",
      "own family to dine with him. Thus the squire will learn to be a good\n",
      "landlord, and grow popular among his tenants, the mother will have eight\n",
      "shillings neat profit, and be fit for work till she produces another\n",
      "child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who are more thrifty (as I must confess the times require) may\n",
      "flea the carcass; the skin of which, artificially dressed, will make\n",
      "admirable gloves for ladies, and summer boots for fine gentlemen.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to our City of Dublin, shambles may be appointed for this purpose, in\n",
      "the most convenient parts of it, and butchers we may be assured will not\n",
      "be wanting; although I rather recommend buying the children alive, and\n",
      "dressing them hot from the knife, as we do roasting pigs.\n",
      "\n",
      "A very worthy person, a true lover of his country, and whose virtues\n",
      "I highly esteem, was lately pleased, in discoursing on this matter, to\n",
      "offer a refinement upon my scheme. He said, that many gentlemen of this\n",
      "kingdom, having of late destroyed their deer, he conceived that the\n",
      "want of venison might be well supply'd by the bodies of young lads and\n",
      "maidens, not exceeding fourteen years of age, nor under twelve; so great\n",
      "a number of both sexes in every country being now ready to starve for\n",
      "want of work and service: And these to be disposed of by their parents\n",
      "if alive, or otherwise by their nearest relations. But with due\n",
      "deference to so excellent a friend, and so deserving a patriot, I\n",
      "cannot be altogether in his sentiments; for as to the males, my American\n",
      "acquaintance assured me from frequent experience, that their flesh was\n",
      "generally tough and lean, like that of our school-boys, by continual\n",
      "exercise, and their taste disagreeable, and to fatten them would not\n",
      "answer the charge. Then as to the females, it would, I think, with\n",
      "humble submission, be a loss to the publick, because they soon would\n",
      "become breeders themselves: And besides, it is not improbable that some\n",
      "scrupulous people might be apt to censure such a practice, (although\n",
      "indeed very unjustly) as a little bordering upon cruelty, which, I\n",
      "confess, hath always been with me the strongest objection against any\n",
      "project, how well soever intended.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in order to justify my friend, he confessed, that this expedient\n",
      "was put into his head by the famous Salmanaazor, a native of the island\n",
      "Formosa, who came from thence to London, above twenty years ago, and in\n",
      "conversation told my friend, that in his country, when any young person\n",
      "happened to be put to death, the executioner sold the carcass to persons\n",
      "of quality, as a prime dainty; and that, in his time, the body of a\n",
      "plump girl of fifteen, who was crucified for an attempt to poison the\n",
      "Emperor, was sold to his imperial majesty's prime minister of state, and\n",
      "other great mandarins of the court in joints from the gibbet, at four\n",
      "hundred crowns. Neither indeed can I deny, that if the same use were\n",
      "made of several plump young girls in this town, who without one single\n",
      "groat to their fortunes, cannot stir abroad without a chair, and appear\n",
      "at a play-house and assemblies in foreign fineries which they never will\n",
      "pay for; the kingdom would not be the worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that vast\n",
      "number of poor people, who are aged, diseased, or maimed; and I have\n",
      "been desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken, to ease\n",
      "the nation of so grievous an incumbrance. But I am not in the least pain\n",
      "upon that matter, because it is very well known, that they are every day\n",
      "dying, and rotting, by cold and famine, and filth, and vermin, as fast\n",
      "as can be reasonably expected. And as to the young labourers, they\n",
      "are now in almost as hopeful a condition. They cannot get work, and\n",
      "consequently pine away from want of nourishment, to a degree, that if\n",
      "at any time they are accidentally hired to common labour, they have not\n",
      "strength to perform it, and thus the country and themselves are happily\n",
      "delivered from the evils to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have too long digressed, and therefore shall return to my subject. I\n",
      "think the advantages by the proposal which I have made are obvious and\n",
      "many, as well as of the highest importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "For first, as I have already observed, it would greatly lessen the\n",
      "number of Papists, with whom we are yearly over-run, being the principal\n",
      "breeders of the nation, as well as our most dangerous enemies, and who\n",
      "stay at home on purpose with a design to deliver the kingdom to the\n",
      "Pretender, hoping to take their advantage by the absence of so many good\n",
      "Protestants, who have chosen rather to leave their country, than stay at\n",
      "home and pay tithes against their conscience to an episcopal curate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, The poorer tenants will have something valuable of their own,\n",
      "which by law may be made liable to a distress, and help to pay their\n",
      "landlord's rent, their corn and cattle being already seized, and money a\n",
      "thing unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, Whereas the maintainance of an hundred thousand children,\n",
      "from two years old, and upwards, cannot be computed at less than\n",
      "ten shillings a piece per annum, the nation's stock will be thereby\n",
      "encreased fifty thousand pounds per annum, besides the profit of a\n",
      "new dish, introduced to the tables of all gentlemen of fortune in the\n",
      "kingdom, who have any refinement in taste. And the money will circulate\n",
      "among our selves, the goods being entirely of our own growth and\n",
      "manufacture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourthly, The constant breeders, besides the gain of eight shillings\n",
      "sterling per annum by the sale of their children, will be rid of the\n",
      "charge of maintaining them after the first year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifthly, This food would likewise bring great custom to taverns,\n",
      "where the vintners will certainly be so prudent as to procure the best\n",
      "receipts for dressing it to perfection; and consequently have their\n",
      "houses frequented by all the fine gentlemen, who justly value themselves\n",
      "upon their knowledge in good eating; and a skilful cook, who understands\n",
      "how to oblige his guests, will contrive to make it as expensive as they\n",
      "please.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sixthly, This would be a great inducement to marriage, which all wise\n",
      "nations have either encouraged by rewards, or enforced by laws and\n",
      "penalties. It would encrease the care and tenderness of mothers towards\n",
      "their children, when they were sure of a settlement for life to the\n",
      "poor babes, provided in some sort by the publick, to their annual profit\n",
      "instead of expence. We should soon see an honest emulation among the\n",
      "married women, which of them could bring the fattest child to the\n",
      "market. Men would become as fond of their wives, during the time of\n",
      "their pregnancy, as they are now of their mares in foal, their cows in\n",
      "calf, or sow when they are ready to farrow; nor offer to beat or kick\n",
      "them (as is too frequent a practice) for fear of a miscarriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many other advantages might be enumerated. For instance, the addition\n",
      "of some thousand carcasses in our exportation of barrel'd beef: the\n",
      "propagation of swine's flesh, and improvement in the art of making good\n",
      "bacon, so much wanted among us by the great destruction of pigs,\n",
      "too frequent at our tables; which are no way comparable in taste or\n",
      "magnificence to a well grown, fat yearly child, which roasted whole will\n",
      "make a considerable figure at a Lord Mayor's feast, or any other publick\n",
      "entertainment. But this, and many others, I omit, being studious of\n",
      "brevity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Supposing that one thousand families in this city, would be constant\n",
      "customers for infants flesh, besides others who might have it at merry\n",
      "meetings, particularly at weddings and christenings, I compute that\n",
      "Dublin would take off annually about twenty thousand carcasses; and the\n",
      "rest of the kingdom (where probably they will be sold somewhat cheaper)\n",
      "the remaining eighty thousand.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can think of no one objection, that will possibly be raised against\n",
      "this proposal, unless it should be urged, that the number of people will\n",
      "be thereby much lessened in the kingdom. This I freely own, and 'twas\n",
      "indeed one principal design in offering it to the world. I desire the\n",
      "reader will observe, that I calculate my remedy for this one individual\n",

What is the probability of drawing one of the 4 most frequent words? What is the probability of drawing one of the 50 most frequent words? Answer these two questions using code rather than just entering in the final answers as numbers. (The answer here should be exact--do not use a randomized procedure to approximate the probability.)"

However, in the result, somewhat meaningless entities have highest PMI values. This might be due to several reasons. First, the entity recognition labeling of spaCy is imperfect. Second, the number of documents (here, newspaper articles) might have been too small. Third, result reflects the nature of PMI, which gives high scores to rare words."
